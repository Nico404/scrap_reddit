My mom wanted to sleep in my room as i had cleaned my room before. I kinda got mad at her cuz I wanted to be alone and study. I told her to just sleep in her room but she didn't. I kept on irritating her and then she said how i dont have humanity and that i dont fulfill my duty as their child and how it is their house and we're just allowed to live in here and how i expect them to understand me but i dont understand them. What she said was a bit hurtful but i feel like i was being really selfish. She hadn't been sleeping at night well and i really feel guilty now idk how wrong i was but i feel really bad.

Due to her family all living in different parts of the world they have scheduled the burial for mid February, and she is getting ready to go.  It has been weeks of support, planning, buying new clothes, and all sorts of shit that I have always wonder why she needs in the first place when she is just going for her father’s funeral, but she’s grieving so I’m not really entitled to say anything.   Note to be said is that any given time she used to go on holiday to her home country -even when the dad was alive- she would go full in with the spending and spending because she wanted to always show off new clothes, or new riches, and most of the times I was financially enabling this behavior.  Anyhow, luck wants it that I got injured on my back pretty badly, I’m still not sure what the problem is because precisely, but it has to do with my spine, and the discs. I’m on a strict bed bound rest for at least a week, with meds that are knocking me off most of the time. It has been three days of this agony, and I’m honestly starting to get extremely worried and frustrated, especially because I live on my own and have nobody to help me.   My partner has other things to think about, and I haven’t asked her, nor she has offered, nor she has come to see me in these days. I’m not expecting her to, but I would’ve appreciated if she did.   She called me earlier to ask if I can look into a perfume she wants to carry on her trip, and I genuinely could not contain myself anymore. I asked her if that’s the only reason she called and frustrated started crying because I am in pain and extremely worried about my health; she said she did not like my response, that if I’m that sick I should go and see my doctor again -I’ve been by the way, and been told to come back once the meds run out to see if there’s any improvement- to not worry about it to try to relax and get better? and that she is stressed because one of her blood tests came back and it’s not good at all,  AITA for not sparing my partner with my whining, while she is going through a major life event?"

We talked about this multiple times and every time I would feel even worse after talking to him so I just now cry silently but he heard me and this morning asked why I cried. I said same reason as I always cry and I said there’s no point in talking to him about it. He said something along the lines of you still can’t get over it so I guess we won’t be able to live together? Am I the asshole for being sad and crying after staying with a cheater because I love him and don’t want to part, and swallowing up my feelings so I don’t bother him after he continues to hurt me over and over."

I rear-ended someone after my car skidded on ice trying to slow down, I know I am at fault and except full responsibility, but I was not given a ticket or citation because I wasn’t driving recklessly and the road conditions that day were rough. When I called my parents they didn’t ask if I was okay, and when they arrived at the scene they didn’t ask if I was okay. They never even said they were happy that I was okay and safe. I don’t have a great relationship with my parents but I at least thought they would ask. For the whole time before they got there I was very calm and relaxed because I knew I did nothing wrong (in the sense of speeding, being on my phone, following to closely, etc..)  and it was an accident that I slipped on the ice. Anything that goes wrong in my life they like to hyper focus on it and hold it over my head. They view me compared to my other siblings as the messy kid who always finds a way to do something wrong. They make jokes about me to my whole family and it hurts a lot. I’m told i don’t deserve anything constantly and it’s really hard to hear because i always just try my best to make them happy but i always mess it up. They don’t have to tell me that they are disappointed in me because of the accident because i can see it every time they look at me and i hate it. I was not injured in the crash but as soon as they arrived i started having massive panic attacks so the EMTs watched me in the ambulance. Anytime my parents came near me or tried to talk to me I would start to panic again to the point i almost fainted multiple times from hyperventilating. The thing is i wasn’t even think or worried about the accident, i started overthinking because i know that i’m gonna have to live in misery with them looking at me like i’m a failure until i do something great and they can forget about it. I was so scared of them and what i know is going to happen because of this incident and i know it’s my fault but i just wish that they would care a bit more about me. because i was having such bad panic attacks around them i was brought to the hospital by ambulance because i couldn’t breathe, my mom didn’t even go to the hospital with me to make sure i was okay. i know i wasn’t physically injured but i just wish that she was there for me. now i’m feeling really angry and depressed from this whole situation. not really the fact that i crashed but the fact that something dangerous happened to me and they didn’t care. So AITA for being angry at my parents even though i crashed my car."

I was really excited to start driving at first and even went out of my way to get it on my birthday. However, the idea of driving now just annoys me.  Typically my mother (46f) would be my supervisor when driving. However, I've noticed recently that whenever I have gone on a drive she is just glued to her phone the whole time. Now this is of course illegal but that part doesn't bother me as much as the fact that I'm brand new to driving and don't know entirely what I'm doing, yet instead of you know, supervising she is just staring at Facebook or some shit. I literally have less than 5 hours on the road.  I've made brief comments about how I would prefer it if she turned it off while I was driving which was mostly met with myself either being ignored or her making some sarcastic comment. However today I just snapped.  I was driving home from my part time job after a shift and like usual she's on her phone. She'll look up every now and then to see or make a comment or two but mostly glued to it. Now in my area there are islands in the middle of the road to prevent speeding and they're very sharp turns that need to be made.  As I'm literally in the area turning around the islands she looks up and says ""you're going too fast"" and I end up hitting the curb.  Well at this point Im so mad and start saying ""I'd actually prefer it if you were looking at the road instead of ur phone the whole time"" to which she says some excuse like ""you've been through there before and been fine."" Now I'm in my room typing this because I don't even wanna talk to her right now but I'm also thinking maybe I was wrong for yelling at her.  Anyway am I the asshole?"

It turns out that my sister invites some colleagues from work to the house, we have a house in the country that is large with a pool and everything. The perfect space to have a good time with friends. They bought everything they were going to eat and drink and they were eating and drinking all day. We (my brother, my mom, my dad and I) went out to buy our own food. So as not to get in the way with their things, but never throughout the day did they offer us anything they cooked. Something that caught our attention because at home we have the custom of whoever brings people always sets aside something of what they will do with their friends so that the rest have proof. And it's not because they owe us something because we put up the house, but it's to share with whoever is there. It turns out that we were hungry and we thought that an avocado was ours and we opened it to eat it. The next day my sister said that she was going to have to pay that the avocado we ate belonged to her and her friends. For one avocado he accuses us of having taken out his things. We, baffled, told her that it was an avocado and that we had put everything else that they did not consider like toilet paper, water and the fucking house so that the party could be held. I told her that she was being selfish and that we always use the habit of leaving something for others and that we didn't know it had been her avocado. Then she began to call us selfish for asking for something in exchange for their stay and that they had gone to different houses and it had never happened that they agreed with the owner. I stressed to her again that it was not necessarily for us but that it was to share and that it was taken as a simple courtesy if you go to a house for the first time. We also did not ask him to leave all the food, just that they offered us a little to taste would have been nice. In the end it seems that this group saved everything left over from the previous party for the next one, which they never told us. I apologized in the same way thinking that they would have problems with their friends, but in the end it was not her friends who had the problem with this, it was her. May clear accounts maintain friendship. But what kind of friends should you worry about owing an avocado? Am I the idiot?"

She’s letting me get my nails done for my birthday party this weekend, but I’ve been debating whether or not I should risk getting black nails or go with red nails. Honestly, it’s more than what she likes or doesn’t like. It’s more that she thinks that black is the color of the devil, which she told me when I put on press on black long nails. She’s devout Catholic, and she used to be goth, and I guess she associates the color black with her past. The only issue though, is that she’s in charge of a lot of stuff for the church we go to. Everyone knows my mom and myself. I’m afraid I’ll embarrass her if I get black nails even though I know that it’s just a color, but I don’t want people to think I’m demonic or something. I don’t know the other church people too well, but I feel like I’d be the AH for getting long black nails and embarrassing my mom for as long as the nails will stay on for. My mom did say I could get any color I wanted, but I don’t know if she also meant black. I’m too afraid to ask her, but I know that it’s probably better to ask her than get it and my mom getting upset about it. I just don’t want my mom to feel ashamed because I like black and the whole goth stuff. I used the black press on nails to see if it would look good with my birthday dress and it does, and I’d like to get it but again, I’m not so sure my mom would like it. So would I be the AH?"

Silly me. Ok anyway, here's where the story starts.  I am very familiar with scams, and the whole 'trust no one online' thing, so I found listings and would only contact people if we could meet up in person to make sure they had tickets and then I would send them the money.  So in comes ""Amanda"", Amanda agreed to these terms and sent me HER HOME ADDRESS. Of course I was like, ok no one who is scamming would do this right? She sends me her Venmo. I STUPIDLY send the money, she then ghosts me of course. But I had her address, so you know... I went to her house.  I checked the open mailbox to see if her name was on the mail. (yep, it was, confirmed it's her house), and then I knocked on the door ya know. No answer, I'll come back later, I'm relentless I'll keep showing up until I get a resolution.  But I got home and I had a better idea. I looked up her name on facebook and I found her profile. The IDIOT had posted a picture of her in her backyard which I was able to confirm on Google maps was her address, so I knew it was her profile for sure.  The next post I found on her page was a repost from a Tiktok account of who her account described as ""her son being silly"". Jackpot. New strategy. I messaged the kid on Tiktok , and since my following is about 100k on Tiktok, the kid was easily influenced by me, I just promised him if he 'sent me \[the money I sent her\] amount of money from his mom's phone (I convinced him somehow that this wasn't morally wrong, its not hard to gaslight a 9 year old) that I would get all of my followers to follow him.  Sure as hell, it worked. The money got sent back to my Venmo and I ghosted the kid.  OF COURSE this wasn't the end of it. The mom either noticed that her money was gone or her kid had to come clean about using her phone while she was in the shower to send me money, but either way the mom had now texted my phone number a LENGTHY response about how disgusting I am for what I did and how she would expose me to my followers, how dare i take advantage of a child, how did I even find them, was I stalking them? How DARE I TAKE MONEY FROM A SINGLE MOTHER.... You know all kinds of crazy things.  I simply responded 'call the police if i did wrong to you.'  I told the story to my friends and one of them told me that i was overreacting and the money clearly affected her more than it would affect me and this was psycho and I should've cut my losses. He's not completely wrong, but the way I see it, I was just bringing justice to myself.  However, I must ask... AITA?"

There would be a total of 18 of us going. We made a group chat to discuss the house we are renting and vacation plans. MIL wanted this trip to be about family quality time and relaxing on the beach. She’s never been to the beach. SIL got angry and decided she didn’t want to go because it was too expensive per person and her adult child wouldn’t be able to afford it either. She left the group chat. Fast forward she calms down decided to still come with and we remake the group chat. She again gets angry after we found a place we liked she said there wasn’t enough stuff to do in that town for her teenagers. Insisting that her teenage children would get bored if all we did was go sailing, play board games, and hang out on the beach. She wanted to go to a bigger city for more things to do. We explained this would be more expensive and we didn’t want a loaded schedule but she was welcome to do as she pleased. Again got angry and left the group chat and said she wasn’t going. After this last issue I suggested that we all just don’t invite her back in and tell her we already booked the place. This weekend we are all supposed to meet at MILs to discuss who is and isn’t going. Am I the asshole for suggesting that we just go without her since she’s said twice now she isn’t going?"

I loved her to death, and we were soul sisters who told each other everything. When our contact lessened during corona, i thought we should take even more steps to regain contact. Even more, i would get to know about her happenings, eg if she dating someone, though someone else, and i would feel neglected. All this led to a confrontational phone call about 6 months ago, where i feel insulted to share, but she actually said that she was tring to give me a hint that she hadn't thought of me as best friends. I didnt know that she found her friendship that weak. She also made me feel guilty that I hadn't helped her when she was going through things in school, when she never even told me if she had problems. In fact, i was the one who stood by her side my her ex bf spread malicious rumours about her AND me, and she went around to hook up with the same guy TWICE again, with total disregard for mine and her self respect. In fact, the guy i liked and asked out said yes and just said he didn't like her friendship with me much, and i took not even a second to tell him that i couldn't date him if he can't handle me being around her. That phone call was the end of me and her. We still behave nicely in our mutual friend group. Because of this, i developed self esteem issues, thinking that no one wants to be friends with me as everyone merely tolerates me, and after a long time i finally made a stable healthy friend group. Me and her met again on New year's Eve, where she said that she was going through things. Even with our personal lack of contact and her bitter end, i still texted her after that, out of pure concern for a human being, telling her if she wanted to talk to or want help, she could reach out to me. It's been weeks, and she hasn't bothered to reply.  AITA for texting and in the entire situation?"
