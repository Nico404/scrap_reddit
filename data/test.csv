My mom wanted to sleep in my room as i had cleaned my room before. I kinda got mad at her cuz I wanted to be alone and study. I told her to just sleep in her room but she didn't. I kept on irritating her and then she said how i dont have humanity and that i dont fulfill my duty as their child and how it is their house and we're just allowed to live in here and how i expect them to understand me but i dont understand them. What she said was a bit hurtful but i feel like i was being really selfish. She hadn't been sleeping at night well and i really feel guilty now idk how wrong i was but i feel really bad.

Due to her family all living in different parts of the world they have scheduled the burial for mid February, and she is getting ready to go.  It has been weeks of support, planning, buying new clothes, and all sorts of shit that I have always wonder why she needs in the first place when she is just going for her father’s funeral, but she’s grieving so I’m not really entitled to say anything.   Note to be said is that any given time she used to go on holiday to her home country -even when the dad was alive- she would go full in with the spending and spending because she wanted to always show off new clothes, or new riches, and most of the times I was financially enabling this behavior.  Anyhow, luck wants it that I got injured on my back pretty badly, I’m still not sure what the problem is because precisely, but it has to do with my spine, and the discs. I’m on a strict bed bound rest for at least a week, with meds that are knocking me off most of the time. It has been three days of this agony, and I’m honestly starting to get extremely worried and frustrated, especially because I live on my own and have nobody to help me.   My partner has other things to think about, and I haven’t asked her, nor she has offered, nor she has come to see me in these days. I’m not expecting her to, but I would’ve appreciated if she did.   She called me earlier to ask if I can look into a perfume she wants to carry on her trip, and I genuinely could not contain myself anymore. I asked her if that’s the only reason she called and frustrated started crying because I am in pain and extremely worried about my health; she said she did not like my response, that if I’m that sick I should go and see my doctor again -I’ve been by the way, and been told to come back once the meds run out to see if there’s any improvement- to not worry about it to try to relax and get better? and that she is stressed because one of her blood tests came back and it’s not good at all,  AITA for not sparing my partner with my whining, while she is going through a major life event?"

I said same reason as I always cry and I said there’s no point in talking to him about it. He said something along the lines of you still can’t get over it so I guess we won’t be able to live together?

I rear-ended someone after my car skidded on ice trying to slow down, I know I am at fault and except full responsibility, but I was not given a ticket or citation because I wasn’t driving recklessly and the road conditions that day were rough. When I called my parents they didn’t ask if I was okay, and when they arrived at the scene they didn’t ask if I was okay. They never even said they were happy that I was okay and safe. I don’t have a great relationship with my parents but I at least thought they would ask. For the whole time before they got there I was very calm and relaxed because I knew I did nothing wrong (in the sense of speeding, being on my phone, following to closely, etc..)  and it was an accident that I slipped on the ice. Anything that goes wrong in my life they like to hyper focus on it and hold it over my head. They view me compared to my other siblings as the messy kid who always finds a way to do something wrong. They make jokes about me to my whole family and it hurts a lot. I’m told i don’t deserve anything constantly and it’s really hard to hear because i always just try my best to make them happy but i always mess it up. They don’t have to tell me that they are disappointed in me because of the accident because i can see it every time they look at me and i hate it. I was not injured in the crash but as soon as they arrived i started having massive panic attacks so the EMTs watched me in the ambulance. Anytime my parents came near me or tried to talk to me I would start to panic again to the point i almost fainted multiple times from hyperventilating. The thing is i wasn’t even think or worried about the accident, i started overthinking because i know that i’m gonna have to live in misery with them looking at me like i’m a failure until i do something great and they can forget about it. I was so scared of them and what i know is going to happen because of this incident and i know it’s my fault but i just wish that they would care a bit more about me. because i was having such bad panic attacks around them i was brought to the hospital by ambulance because i couldn’t breathe, my mom didn’t even go to the hospital with me to make sure i was okay. i know i wasn’t physically injured but i just wish that she was there for me. now i’m feeling really angry and depressed from this whole situation. not really the fact that i crashed but the fact that something dangerous happened to me and they didn’t care.

I was really excited to start driving at first and even went out of my way to get it on my birthday. However, the idea of driving now just annoys me.  Typically my mother (46f) would be my supervisor when driving. However, I've noticed recently that whenever I have gone on a drive she is just glued to her phone the whole time. Now this is of course illegal but that part doesn't bother me as much as the fact that I'm brand new to driving and don't know entirely what I'm doing, yet instead of you know, supervising she is just staring at Facebook or some shit. I literally have less than 5 hours on the road.  I've made brief comments about how I would prefer it if she turned it off while I was driving which was mostly met with myself either being ignored or her making some sarcastic comment. However today I just snapped.  I was driving home from my part time job after a shift and like usual she's on her phone. She'll look up every now and then to see or make a comment or two but mostly glued to it. Now in my area there are islands in the middle of the road to prevent speeding and they're very sharp turns that need to be made.  As I'm literally in the area turning around the islands she looks up and says ""you're going too fast"" and I end up hitting the curb.  Well at this point Im so mad and start saying ""I'd actually prefer it if you were looking at the road instead of ur phone the whole time"" to which she says some excuse like ""you've been through there before and been fine."" Now I'm in my room typing this because I don't even wanna talk to her right now but I'm also thinking maybe I was wrong for yelling at her.  Anyway am I the asshole?"

It turns out that my sister invites some colleagues from work to the house, we have a house in the country that is large with a pool and everything. The perfect space to have a good time with friends. They bought everything they were going to eat and drink and they were eating and drinking all day. We (my brother, my mom, my dad and I) went out to buy our own food. So as not to get in the way with their things, but never throughout the day did they offer us anything they cooked. Something that caught our attention because at home we have the custom of whoever brings people always sets aside something of what they will do with their friends so that the rest have proof. And it's not because they owe us something because we put up the house, but it's to share with whoever is there. It turns out that we were hungry and we thought that an avocado was ours and we opened it to eat it. The next day my sister said that she was going to have to pay that the avocado we ate belonged to her and her friends. For one avocado he accuses us of having taken out his things. We, baffled, told her that it was an avocado and that we had put everything else that they did not consider like toilet paper, water and the fucking house so that the party could be held. I told her that she was being selfish and that we always use the habit of leaving something for others and that we didn't know it had been her avocado. Then she began to call us selfish for asking for something in exchange for their stay and that they had gone to different houses and it had never happened that they agreed with the owner. I stressed to her again that it was not necessarily for us but that it was to share and that it was taken as a simple courtesy if you go to a house for the first time. We also did not ask him to leave all the food, just that they offered us a little to taste would have been nice. In the end it seems that this group saved everything left over from the previous party for the next one, which they never told us. I apologized in the same way thinking that they would have problems with their friends, but in the end it was not her friends who had the problem with this, it was her. May clear accounts maintain friendship. But what kind of friends should you worry about owing an avocado? Am I the idiot?"

She’s letting me get my nails done for my birthday party this weekend, but I’ve been debating whether or not I should risk getting black nails or go with red nails. Honestly, it’s more than what she likes or doesn’t like. It’s more that she thinks that black is the color of the devil, which she told me when I put on press on black long nails. She’s devout Catholic, and she used to be goth, and I guess she associates the color black with her past. The only issue though, is that she’s in charge of a lot of stuff for the church we go to. Everyone knows my mom and myself. I’m afraid I’ll embarrass her if I get black nails even though I know that it’s just a color, but I don’t want people to think I’m demonic or something. I don’t know the other church people too well, but I feel like I’d be the AH for getting long black nails and embarrassing my mom for as long as the nails will stay on for. My mom did say I could get any color I wanted, but I don’t know if she also meant black. I’m too afraid to ask her, but I know that it’s probably better to ask her than get it and my mom getting upset about it. I just don’t want my mom to feel ashamed because I like black and the whole goth stuff. I used the black press on nails to see if it would look good with my birthday dress and it does, and I’d like to get it but again, I’m not so sure my mom would like it. So would I be the AH?"

Silly me. Ok anyway, here's where the story starts.  I am very familiar with scams, and the whole 'trust no one online' thing, so I found listings and would only contact people if we could meet up in person to make sure they had tickets and then I would send them the money.  So in comes ""Amanda"", Amanda agreed to these terms and sent me HER HOME ADDRESS. Of course I was like, ok no one who is scamming would do this right? She sends me her Venmo. I STUPIDLY send the money, she then ghosts me of course. But I had her address, so you know... I went to her house.  I checked the open mailbox to see if her name was on the mail. (yep, it was, confirmed it's her house), and then I knocked on the door ya know. No answer, I'll come back later, I'm relentless I'll keep showing up until I get a resolution.  But I got home and I had a better idea. I looked up her name on facebook and I found her profile. The IDIOT had posted a picture of her in her backyard which I was able to confirm on Google maps was her address, so I knew it was her profile for sure.  The next post I found on her page was a repost from a Tiktok account of who her account described as ""her son being silly"". Jackpot. New strategy. I messaged the kid on Tiktok , and since my following is about 100k on Tiktok, the kid was easily influenced by me, I just promised him if he 'sent me \[the money I sent her\] amount of money from his mom's phone (I convinced him somehow that this wasn't morally wrong, its not hard to gaslight a 9 year old) that I would get all of my followers to follow him.  Sure as hell, it worked. The money got sent back to my Venmo and I ghosted the kid.  OF COURSE this wasn't the end of it. The mom either noticed that her money was gone or her kid had to come clean about using her phone while she was in the shower to send me money, but either way the mom had now texted my phone number a LENGTHY response about how disgusting I am for what I did and how she would expose me to my followers, how dare i take advantage of a child, how did I even find them, was I stalking them? How DARE I TAKE MONEY FROM A SINGLE MOTHER.... You know all kinds of crazy things.  I simply responded 'call the police if i did wrong to you.'  I told the story to my friends and one of them told me that i was overreacting and the money clearly affected her more than it would affect me and this was psycho and I should've cut my losses. He's not completely wrong, but the way I see it, I was just bringing justice to myself.  However, I must ask... AITA?"

She’s never been to the beach. SIL got angry and decided she didn’t want to go because it was too expensive per person and her adult child wouldn’t be able to afford it either. She left the group chat. Fast forward she calms down decided to still come with and we remake the group chat. She again gets angry after we found a place we liked she said there wasn’t enough stuff to do in that town for her teenagers. Insisting that her teenage children would get bored if all we did was go sailing, play board games, and hang out on the beach. She wanted to go to a bigger city for more things to do. We explained this would be more expensive and we didn’t want a loaded schedule but she was welcome to do as she pleased. Again got angry and left the group chat and said she wasn’t going. After this last issue I suggested that we all just don’t invite her back in and tell her we already booked the place.

All this led to a confrontational phone call about 6 months ago, where i feel insulted to share, but she actually said that she was tring to give me a hint that she hadn't thought of me as best friends. I didnt know that she found her friendship that weak. She also made me feel guilty that I hadn't helped her when she was going through things in school, when she never even told me if she had problems. In fact, i was the one who stood by her side my her ex bf spread malicious rumours about her AND me, and she went around to hook up with the same guy TWICE again, with total disregard for mine and her self respect. In fact, the guy i liked and asked out said yes and just said he didn't like her friendship with me much, and i took not even a second to tell him that i couldn't date him if he can't handle me being around her. That phone call was the end of me and her. We still behave nicely in our mutual friend group. Because of this, i developed self esteem issues, thinking that no one wants to be friends with me as everyone merely tolerates me, and after a long time i finally made a stable healthy friend group. Me and her met again on New year's Eve, where she said that she was going through things. Even with our personal lack of contact and her bitter end, i still texted her after that, out of pure concern for a human being, telling her if she wanted to talk to or want help, she could reach out to me.

After about two weeks he confessed that he had feelings for me and we started dating. I wanted to keep it private because I didn’t want our relationship to be infiltrated by other people’s gossip, perceptions, etc, I just wanted it to be ours. So, we kept our relationship secret; no one knew about it except for us and his roommates.  I would hang out with my roommate, a friend, and the guy I was seeing sometimes in group settings, but they did not know we were dating.  I was pretty close to my roommate and this friend and we spent a lot of time together. With my roommate, I would insult her (tell her I hate her, to shut up, etc) sarcastically/in a joking way. She would do the same to me (would say fuck you to me in a joking tone). Neither of us ever seemed bothered by it.  After the end of my relationship with the guy (it only lasted two months), I mentioned it one time to another friend while my roommate was there. My roommate was surprised since she didn’t know about it. We glossed over it and changed the topic. Later that night, I jokingly said I hated my roommate.  She didn’t say anything in the moment, but the next morning, she snapped at me. She said I obviously didn’t want to share with her but with our friend I was willing to spill, and if we weren’t actually close, I shouldn’t say those kinds of things (I hate you/shut up) to her because it’s strong language and it’s disrespectful. I said I didn’t have to share things with her if I didn’t want to, and that I was obviously joking when I said those things, that I didn’t know it bothered her but I wouldn’t make jokes like that anymore.  She later complained to a mutual friend about me for hours that weekend mentioning times that I excluded her from outings. If anything, I actually included her; she is chronically late (often 1 hr+) and my friends often would avoid making plans with her because of it, but I would always ask if she could join. She knew them through me, so if I did not invite her she would not go.  Things were tense and we didn’t talk for two days. I felt uncomfortable since she had raised her voice at me. One time I left for class without acknowledging her and she sent me a message saying “are you just going to be fucking weird about things and ignore me? Because if that’s what you’re going to do make it clear.”  I felt like I was getting shit from her for jokingly saying I hated her but that text was actually disrespectful and strong language. We had an argument where I told her this. She voiced she knew I was always joking but she doesn’t like those kinds of jokes. I thought it was hypocritical since she would say f you to me as a joke. She said she was hurt by me not telling her I was dating the guy.  Though we made up, I still haven’t fully forgiven her for lashing out on me and sending that message. I feel that I should be able to choose to keep a relationship to myself if I want to. AITA?"

Fast forward 2 years, we've had a few conversations, all of which have been pretty jovial and normal. (Think HAHAHAHAHHA &amp; LMFAO). Since I moved away, he started a band and a discord for that band, so I DM him one day and go ""Yo! Send me the discord!"" and I get left on read. Come to find out, it looks like he's blocked me?  Seemed SO out of the blue, especially since our last convo was the same super interactive shit only a month previous. Kind of hurt, and a little upset. I keep thinking I've done something wrong but I'm just don't know. Am I the asshole?"

We will go away together or for a meal. This involves someone checking who is coming, booking a place, paying a deposit, and collecting money. I am that person in our family group. Over the years one person in my family, that’s call them H (F35) has started to find fault in whatever is booked. She is often supported by another person called S (F35) in this.  Yesterday my mum (62) contacted members of our family, these are myself, J (M28), B (F36), D (F48) H, and S, to ask if we want to go away to an event for a weekend. She asks us what our budget is for accommodation, most of us can go to £100 per person per night, except S and H who can do £50 a night. My mum asked us to help find accommodation for that price. Even for £50 a night we can find a nice place. S shares a link to a small, 2 bedroom, basement apartment, with sofa bed for 2 nights costing £52pp. This can accommodate 6, there’s 7 of us going. It has no car parking, one bathroom and isn’t practical for 7 people. I found a 3 bedroom house, with 2 bathrooms, kitchen, dining room and living room with sofa bed. One bedroom has a king bed, one twin beds and one bunk beds. It has parking and for 2 nights is £50. Everyone except for J and H looks at it and agrees we should book it. There isn’t a lot available in the £50 price range as we are going to a big event, that attracts a lot of people to a small village. These are the two options we have. S says she won’t sleep in a bunk bed, then H says she won’t sleep in a bunk bed either. Fair enough they don’t have to, D and B volunteered to take the bunk beds. B is annoyed by this, because we didn’t stipulate a £50 budget, S and H did. I also agree that it’s not OK to specify a budget that’s half the price of what everyone else is willing to pay, but expect every room to have beds that aren’t bunks. Voicing this view resulted in H getting personal with B and me, saying that we (me and B) can’t afford £100. H and S continued to double down on not sleeping in a bunk and that for £50 each we can find something without bunks. I looked and could only find one house without bunks, this house is £225 each for the 2 nights. The argument continued, and H and S carried on about the bunks. H and S were asked to shop around to find better but they ignored this and carried on, in the end I left the chat, and canceled the accommodation at the request of my mum, who decided to cancel the whole trip. H &amp; S think IATA because I booked without everyone agreeing on a place. I think they are in the assholes, for not offering suitable alternatives, stipulating a budget, going on about the bunks (after others said they’d sleep in them), and failing to consider the compromise the whole group made for them."

My boyfriend and I live in the middle of nowhere in Europe. Is cold and snowy. Our heater hasn't been working properly the last few days, so we've been cold.   He works in a store the whole day while I stay at home. I dress in warm clothes and drink a lot of tea. After he leaves, I ventilate our bedroom 2 times per day, per mutual agreement, because we had some mold issues in the past.   At night, we are cold. I manage, I guess I just try not to think much about it and get it over. But it is particularly hard for him and he complains about it a lot. So last night, we decided to take a warm shower together before bed. However, 5 minutes in, I had to leave. He wanted the water extremely hot and I just couldn't take it. Even he admitted that the water burned his skin, but still was enjoying it.   In truth, I was annoyed I had to leave the shower so fast. But I accepted it and didn't say anything.  When he comes to the bedroom, he looks like a lobster. But even then he was still cold so he puts a warm sweater. A few minutes later, he gets frustrated out of nowhere and says his body is cold and his face is burning. He says this is very triggering for him, so he wants to open all the windows to cooldown.   I get upset and said no. I tell him it's not fair for me, I already had to leave the shower early, the room is already cold and my hair is still wet. We don't have a fire or something like this to warm up after. As a compromise, I told him he could go outside and cooldown there. Upon hearing this, he gets extremely upset, says I disrespect him and that I don't support him through his sickness.  Because I saw him getting so mad, I caved in and said it was fine to open the windows. However, he says my tone is not honest and ended up going outside. When he came back, he kept making snarky comments which I ignored and just went to sleep.   It is the next day and we're not talking yet. He just messaged me from work saying he hopes I enjoy the room alone for the next 10h and to not forget to not let him open the windows for 5 minutes when he comes home. Last night, he didn't say 5 minutes, but still. My brain tells me his request is unreasonable (and questionable, but that's beside the point). I know if I apologize, he will make me promise not to do it again and then the matter would be solved. But at the same time, I do believe he is just throwing a tantrum for not getting what he wants and I am not sorry.   AITA for not wanting to open the windows?"

Recently, my best friend has been consistently showing up late and not respecting the start time we agreed upon. I know he's been going through a tough time in his personal life, he lost his job and his relationship ended. He confided in me that he has been struggling with depression and alcohol addiction. I tried to be understanding and patient, but last night, he showed up an hour late and visibly drunk, and we had already started the game without him. I offered for him to stay and watch us play, but he demanded that we start the game over for him. I lost my patience and told him that if he can't show up on time and be respectful of our agreed upon start time, he can't come to our game nights anymore. He then got angry, flipped the board of the game we were playing (Risk) over and left. He's now claiming that I'm being a terrible friend and that he's been going through some personal issues that have been causing him to be late.  I feel guilty for kicking him out, but at the same time, I feel like I need to stand up for myself and the others in the group. We all have our own issues to deal with and it's not fair for one person to consistently disrupt the game night. I want to support my friend and help him through his struggles, but I also don't want to enable his behaviour.  So, Reddit, AITA for kicking my best friend out of our weekly game night?"

I said same reason as I always cry and I said there’s no point in talking to him about it. He said something along the lines of you still can’t get over it so I guess we won’t be able to live together?

Baby’s dad and I have never been together and had our baby as a surprise.    One of baby’s dad’s main concerns was whether or not baby was truly his, when he expressed interest in doing a paternity test I was supportive of the idea but expressed it did hurt my feelings, as I had been clear when we started talking that even though we weren’t together I wouldn’t have any other partners.* regardless I agreed and thought that was the end of the conversation, until he clarified that he wanted me to get the test while I was still pregnant, to which I did refuse. Not to the test as a whole but while I was pregnant, the tests are incredibly invasive and can be quite dangerous for a fetus in gestation, in some cases even leading to miscarriage, I simply didn’t want to risk it. He insisted as he didn’t want to support me while I was pregnant just to find out baby wasn’t his. I welcomed him to wait until the baby was born but I wasn’t doing the test until then. He chose to stay.   Baby was born and came out with a birth ‘marking’ of sorts that was inherited from baby’s dad and grandfather. He was convinced and decided to not do the test. Tonight baby’s dad texted saying that he won’t be coming home because he just found out his blood type is A- and that baby must not be his. I suggested there must be some kind of mix up or he (baby’s father) has the same blood type as his father (baby’s grandpa) AB. I supported the idea of him getting another test done and he scolded me saying I never trust doctors and that I’m trying to trick him into fathering a baby.   This is where I might be the asshole I told him to ‘stop drinking and go to bed’ instead of consoling him as he said all he was asking for was sympathy being he just learned some horrible news. When I had suggested that he get a paternity test to put this issue to bed he got mad again stating that I was making demands of him instead of understanding how hurt he is.   I understand that baby’s dad doesn’t know me from Adam and I’m not expecting him to just trust my word and I never did, but I didn’t force the issue for the test because I know the truth. He has spent the last 5 months knowing that this baby is his and acknowledging that baby looks like him and other family members just to read some thing from I don’t know where telling him that his blood type doesn’t match baby’s and won’t get an actual test.    TLDR: baby’s dad doesn’t think baby is his, told him to take a test, he called me insensitive to his upset.      *this is a personal choice as I prefer to get tested, no one wants STD’s, in between partners and in case this exact situation happened I never wanted to have to worry ‘who’s the father’. I know for a fact baby is his as I hadn’t been with anyone else for 11 months before I had gotten pregnant."

Most of the time it’s just me talking to my mum or sister normally, not about anything that could cause anxiety. This isn’t the only restriction I have because of my parents fear of my sisters anxiety, but one of the worst. I can’t even speak anymore without being told off.

Now this is of course illegal but that part doesn’t bother me as much as the fact that I’m brand new to driving and don’t know entirely what I’m doing, yet instead of you know, supervising she is just staring at Facebook or some shit. I literally have less than 5 hours on the road.  I’ve made brief comments about how I would prefer it if she turned it off while I was driving which was mostly met with myself either being ignored or her making some sarcastic comment. However today I just snapped.   I was driving home from my part time job after a shift and like usual she’s on her phone. She’ll look up every now and then to see or make a comment or two but mostly glued to it. Now in my area there are islands in the middle of the road to prevent speeding and they’re very sharp turns that need to be made.   As I’m literally in the area turning around the islands she looks up and says “you’re going too fast” and I end up hitting the curb.   Well at this point Im so mad and start saying “I’d actually prefer it if you were looking at the road instead of ur phone the whole time” to which she says some excuse like “you’ve been through there before and been fine.” Now I’m in my room typing this because I don’t even wanna talk to her right now but I’m also thinking maybe I was wrong for yelling at her.

The building has 4 floors with two apartments on each floor. I happen to live on the first floor and for some reason, everyone chooses the first floor to come and smoke their weed. Personally I never had an issue with weed because I used to smoke myself but when I had my daughter it began to be an issue.   Her bedroom is directly across from the front door to my apartment so whenever they decide to smoke weed in the halls it goes directly to her bedroom. She also has asthma so there have been times that I have to remove my daughter from her room while she's playing because their smoking and her room reeks of weed. Each time I see someone in the halls smoking, I explain the situation and they apologize and go outside. It is only ever the neighbors from one apartment that continue doing it and that are a huge problem for me.   I've had numerous discussions with this specific neighbor and he'll stop for a little and then he continues. I've even tried to compromise and asked him to just smoke with the building door open so we smell it less. At times he'll do just that, but a lot of the times he will keep the door shut and smoke even closer to my door now (on the stairs leading up to my apartment). To make matters worse, he always has at LEAST two or three others with him. They will literally have the entire hallway full of smoke and not air it out until confronted. I have to remind him often and it's frustrating because now it just feels like blatant disrespect and disregard for my child.   Today he did it again and I went out and addressed him respectfully. He responded with ""I don't have time for this, you can go. You don't say this to anyone else"" ( My husband asks everyone he sees not to smoke in the hallways and they apologize and move). I was livid and I lost my cool. We began shouting at one another and it was extremely loud. His sister comes running down the stairs to defend him and it almost came to blows (because of her). I explained to her what was going on when he walked away and she seemed to understand at first. Ultimately, she walks up the stairs with him and says verbatim ""He obviously doesn't give a F about what you're asking so we're gonna keep smoking."" I threatened to call police and the landlord and she responded with ""go ahead.""   They did come back in the hallways 15 mins later to smoke again but this time they kept the door open. They also kept it open while smoking hours after that.   Am I the asshole? How should I handle this now? Wondering if I should escalate and go to the landlord or police."

As I don’t want to write out my whole life story, here’s an abridged version:   - mother was always a heavy drinker - she was incredibly abusive, leaving bruises on all of my siblings constantly  - came out at 14 to hear “No you’re not! We are not having one of those THINGS in this family” - left for days at a time, leaving me with no food, electricity or heating.  - kicked me out at 14 after I snapped at her for drinking, she threw a stiletto at me which I still have a scar from.  - she destroyed my sisters chance at studying abroad in America.  - she is an all around narcissist and refuses to admit to anything or see fault with any of it.   So, it was my birthday a few days ago, as I’m away for university, I didn’t get to see my family but my boyfriend and I made plans to go out with a friend.   My mother had been trying to get into contact with me for the past few months through family members who still are in contact with her, asking for phone numbers, friend requests on Facebook etc. I had ignore all of the attempts as I have made it very clear to her over the years that I want nothing to do with her.   So on my bday, I get a phone call from an unrecognised number and answer it, thinking it was one of the plumbers I was waiting to get in touch about fixing a burst pipe, only to hear a lot of talking in the background, I knew it was a pub simply from the type of noise, followed by a very slurred “Hello?” From my mother.  Before she could get another word in I hung up and blocked the number.  I contacted my family asking who gave her my phone number but no one admitted to it, instead calling me immature and saying I should have at least accepted the birthday wishes.  But I refuse to interact with a woman who actively destroyed my life and the lives of those around me, showing no remorse at all.   So , should I have at least heard another word? Or am I right to stick to my attempt at NC?"

One day i drew one member of a particular band that i really like and put it on my story on insta, and my best friend recognized it and said it's someone from her crush's favorite group. So my best friend sent my drawing to her and she really liked it and my best friend ended up giving her my instagram so her crush could text me. (btw i did not ask my best friend to do that! it was actually her own idea to give her my username since she probably thought we wont be really friends)So her crush texted me something like ""heyy!! i really liked your drawing!"" and we somehow kind of started making a conversation abt other groups and stuff, and now we are good friends. only friends. i really dont see her in a romantic way and she doesn't see me in a romantic way because she said she doesn't feel that very often and she doesn't want a relationship. So one day we all met up, me, my best friend, and her crush and some other classmates from my best friend's class. after we wanted to go home, it was like 5 pm, my best friend's crush asked me if i wanted to come iver to her house, since we takked about it before, because she has a lot of albums that i wanted to see in real life and not only on the internet, so i said of course. and when i told my best friend that im not going home yet and that im going over to her crush's house, she looked at me in disgust and just walked away. later that night she texted me and said things like ""i wish i never introduced you two"" and that what i did was too much.. she is not talking to ke and its been more then a week, probably two now and idk what to do... i just wanted a friend who has similar interests:( so, AITA?"

My mother recreated some trauma of mine . I should mention that my mother and father are going through a heated divorce right now. besides the point, the night the arugement happened i called my dad to come and get me along with some of my things because i said that i never wanted to go back there. i did end up going back there for more things but thats a whole different story. before i left with my dad i said i didnt want to see or talk to her until she could apologize to me. about a week later my sister (8 female) and my brother (9 male) told my the my room was empty and my things were in trash bags. they also said my sister was not moving into my room. She also has my phone which my father pays for but this is another story. My mom has painted me the villain to my family on her side.

I've been having a really hard time with body confidence lately and I'm living with my parents still (I'm getting my Master's and rent is crazy where I am) and my parents are not people I can emotionally depend on for stuff like this. I'm also getting my Master's in counseling-- I just started the program last week (this will be relevant in a sec). (also I literally looked for a therapist for myself earlier today, so please no comments that I should just go to therapy. I'm working on it and my bf knows it)  My bf was fine with me being quiet; he just played his game and I played music for both of us on my Apple music. I opened up a little bit later and started to talk more, and apologized for being quiet. I was clear from the beginning that me being quiet wasn't anything to do with him, it was just a problem with me. He said everything was fine. But a little while later, after I stopped being quiet, he said ""Imagine if you went to therapy and your therapist was just quiet for a while and unhappy."" This was weird to me because why should I be held to professional standards in my relationship? People yell sometimes at home and that doesn't mean they yell in the office.  So I'm upset with him, and said that I didn't like him saying stuff like that (he's done this multiple times in the past and every time he did I told him that I didn't like it). I told him that it put too much pressure on me-- even counselors need people to rely on in times of need and have imperfect moments, and it implied that I was going to fail in my field. He basically just said ""I don't think you need to be held to professional standards in this relationship"" but didn't really go back on anything he said. Maybe I'm overreacting, Idk. AITA?"

Jack used to take public transit and I used to be stuck in traffic on the QEW (local highway that's notoriously slow) so being able to take the HOV and cruise into work cut my commute time in half, it was a win win.   The problem, Jack smells awful. Like not just like a little BO after a workout, but like fucking rank rotting onions. At work its tolerable but sitting in a car for almost 40 minutes a day is just unbearable, and the smell lingers for long after he's gone so my car just permanently smells abysmal. So after about 2 weeks of commuting together I had enough.   I decided that I should probably just be honest with him about the reason, and told him that the body odor was becoming unpleasant for me and that I didn't want to carpool anymore. He got really upset, telling me that it was unfair for me to just decided out of the blue to double his commute time and make him pay for public transit. When I talked to my girlfriend she said I should've at least asked him to shower or something before just refusing to drive together, but previous complaints have been made in the office and he didn't change his behavior so I assumed there was no point here. I genuinely feel awful and I don't know if I'm the asshole here. Any thoughts?"

Recently, I was at the hospital for an appointment. I found a space right next to the entrance, in between a low wall and another car. 15 minutes later, I came to leave but found that my access was restricted by a large expensive 4x4 type vehicle. The car had parked in front of the entrance over a box with yellow horizontal lines on it, which I had also taken to mean 'no parking'. I wasn't overly surprised to see a car there, as there aren't enough spaces in the car park for the number of people who use the hospital and I assumed the driver probably thought they would be in and out quickly. However, I figured that if I used my mirrors and did some Austin Powers style manoeuvring back and forth I could get my car out safely and be on my way. I was midway through doing this when the owner came out, we made eye contact and she approached my passenger side, I lowered my window and she told me in a rather confrontational way that she had been dropping off an elderly relative who couldn't walk. I didn't want to escalate things so I just told her it was fine and pulled my car back into the space whilst I waited for her to move.

Now, I already know this isn’t the healthiest friendship—she caught feelings a long time ago and has since had trouble setting/respecting boundaries—but we’re such close friends we decided to make it work regardless. However, about a month ago, after she admitted she had been lying for some time about being over me (she has a boyfriend she’s trying to make it work with) I told her we should take some distance, for the sake of both of our partners. She agreed, but she keeps hitting me up every couple weeks saying she can’t wait to talk again; this has been the case in previous instances when she has decided to take distance for her relationship. Again, I think she’s a little nuts, but I love her and don’t want to stop being friends.   My other friend, let’s call him Chris (M21). We’d hung out as a group before, but never just the two of them. Recently he’s mentioned that Izzy has been asking to hang out with him. She called me the other night, drunk off her ass and rambling about how we have “a karmic bond,” how she’s “done with the toxicity,” and that she loves me and thinks we’ll be together some day, even though I don’t see it. Among these things, she mentioned that she’s only hanging out with Chris to get close to me (I don’t even know how that makes sense in her mind), and when I mentioned that it doesn’t sound like she’s “done with the toxicity,” she insisted that she’s not gonna sleep with him, as if that was the problem I was referring to.   I ended up letting Chris know what she said, since it sounded like she’s not interested in being genuine friends with him and I feel like he deserves to not be strung along. He confronted her about it, and she confronted me about it, telling me I betrayed her trust and that I took what she said completely out of context. I feel bad because in retrospect I do think she was genuinely looking for a friend and worded it poorly to me, but I also think that at the time she sounded really manipulative and I felt like I owed it to Chris to tell him the truth and was just looking out for a friend.

My mom gave me her old iPhone XS because I lost money and stuff.  She said she will never buy me a new phone until September because Apple would put USB-C starting from iPhone 15.  A month later, I dropped my phone and the screen broke.  I decided that I should get a used phone that is the same model as my current one because it is cheaper than fixing it.  I keep slicing my finger when using the broken phone.  The problem is, my mom hates me using my money.  Because Asian parents usually don't allow kids to do part-time jobs, most of my money is a gift from my grandparents.  Subway and food expenses go out of my bank account, and she does not care because it is a necessity.  However, she hates me using the money for electronics because Asians think electronics = distraction.  I asked my mom if I can get a used phone that I can use until she buys me the new 15 Pro Max.  She got furious.  She told me that I do not have the right to use my money since the law states that parents have the right to control what their kids own.  She also said that it is morally wrong to use money like this.  She said that she struggles to buy food these days (which is weird because my grandparents support my mom and she buys fashion items every month), and owes a debt to the bank.  She told me that since I broke the promise about not wasting money, she thinks that I am a liar.  Do I deserve this much hate for trying to prevent a finger slice?  AITA?"

Today she practically scratched a kids eye out .  There were multiple incidents where Julie has went around attacking these kids and they would finally retaliate and bite back.

I implied where there were a few moments  but overall not a bad day.  This is the back and fourth we had  “It was a great day for Julie today, much better than yesterday “  “Oh you mean where my daughter wasn’t brutally attacked and you did nothing about it?”  “I’m sorry you feel that way, but ma’am I’ve had to break up various altercations that your daughter has started. I’ll turn my head for one second and she’s trying to scratch someone without cause. Me and another teacher have witnessed her trying to bite and scratch at someone simply because they took a step too close to her  or will literally follow someone around just to scratch them“  She wasn’t hearing it, told the director on me, I was written up. Now that I think about it I could have worded that another way, but it’s just my observations and she didn’t seem to really care about the other kid being hurt ."

I got to know my then-situationship in tinder 7 months ago. We live 500km away from each other so we dated on weekends and naturally didn't get to know each other that much. When we were 6 weeks or so deep in our relationship we believed she was pregnant even though she was on birth control. It was a false alarm and I informed her that I have no desire to have children, ever. Not now, not in 10 years, never. So if she wanted to still keep screwing me she had to agree to an abortion if such an unfortunate event was to take place. And she did.   Fast-forward three months. I had lost my feelings if there even was any and decided to end our relationship for good. She wasn't good with it and she was a real pain in the ass for a couple of weeks, but then gave up trying to make me reconcile. Now, when I'm writing this, she texted me that she's pregnant, regardless we used contraceptions, and she wants to keep the baby. She knows exactly what are my thoughts on this and what contribution I'll give to the baby. None. I'm not going to acknowledge my paternity or anything. The baby is and will be like air to me and likely in no more than 2 weeks I have forgotten that I have got someone pregnant. We had an agreement about abortion and still she is surprised that I do not care about her nor the baby. Am I the asshole in here?

Part of this issue too is she's never had her own place, lived with her parents up until this year when she moved in with me. I can tell she's kind of nervous to get her own apartment and feel the financial pressure. So I like feel obligated to take care of her or like pay half of her rent or something. Or get my own office and hang out there all the time. She wants marriage and kids and house in the next couple of years and I don't even know if I feel ok with any of that just yet.

I hope she doesn't see this. I have seen her on Reddit in the past.    So my sister (F21) (sister A for the sake of clarity) decided that today we were going to watch a movie. ""We"" as in the aforementioned sister A, our older sister (F28) (sister B), one of our older sister's friends (F??), my mom (F55), and I (M16).     Earlier that night, I notice a smell a few times, and assume it's probably the cats (we have multiple) or something. While we're watching the movie, I smell it again, and I go ""is it you? that bad smell I keep smelling? does anyone else smell that"" and sniff in the direction of sister B, because I'm on the couch and she's sitting on the floor right in front of me. Her friend was sitting on the couch next to me (with sister A next to her). I did not at any time suspect it was the friend, because I \*thought\* I smelled it before she even arrived (Friend arrived after sister B). Sister A volunteers the information that the smell is her feet, and I immediately accept it as fact because she has a NOTABLE HISTORY OF BAD SMELLING FEET. I get at her for it and say she needs to wash them and that it's gross and all. Because we're related. It would be different if it wasn't my sister. Of course it would. She tells me to shut up a few times, but I keep going for a minute because I was like ""ew lol"". My mom joined in as well. I did not at ANY POINT suspect that it would /NOT/ be her feet, because she said it was hers, and I would not have \*\*\*\*EVER COME TO THE CONCLUSION \*\*\*\* that it was even someones feet if she didn't explicitly say it was her smell and her \*feet\*. Feet would have never even been considered. I cannot stress this enough.    We eventually stop going at her for it (after literally one minute) and continue watching the movie. I would have forgotten this even happened. It would have never been in my thoughts again. The movie ends, we talk about it a bit, and sister B &amp; friend leave. I go to make a snack. While I make a snack, sister A presents me with the notion that it wasn't her smell. She says she was covering for sister B's friend, and that it was really rude of me to get at her for it, because friend had to listen to me say she was gross. I feel bad, obviously. I would never say something like that to someone who isn't in my family! Jesus Christ! But how was I supposed to know that? That isn't a reasonable expectation!! AGAIN, I \*never\* would have even thought it was someone's feet if it weren't for her saying it was HER FEET. I would've just sniffed sister B, went ""Oh, no, the strange smell is not you. Hmm. Must be the cats.""  She says I should've known because she told me to shut up a few times. But the thing is, she always tells me to shut up. That isn't out of the ordinary.

For those of you that don't know, part of the celebrations include giving red packets with some money in it (a very toxic practice imo) for unmarried younger relatives, mostly kids.  My wife 25F (I am 28M) was preparing the red packets when I was reminded of how rude some of her relatives' kids were. I'm talking 18 year olds, 20 year olds. Not toddlers or even below 10 year old kids. They're so rude they don't even say hi sometimes when I arrive into let's say, her grandparents home, even though i am elder than them and in our culture you have to call them by their title when you meet them. So thinking about this, I became very angry and i told her not to give any red packets to them. She agreed with me that they are rude, but her opinion is that it is still our responsibility to uphold this part of our tradition even if they are rude, and we are not giving much anyway ($8 each to five kids)  I saw red when she said that because we are currently going through some things that require money and we are deeping a lot into our savings, so i stood my ground. That started an argument and she was obsessing over the fact that this will be very embarassing for us and for her family if we don't give the red packets even though we have been married for 2 years already and we didn't give for the past years, and she said that we are giving red packets to the other relatives kids so it is unfair if we didnt give them. I felt that she was caring too much about what others think about us and her 'face' so I insisted and didnt give in. this went on until she threatened me to not turn up at all for any of the visiting that we had agreed to do before hand, and this is a big deal in our tradition (unless you had a valid reason like sickness or important events etc). I saw red and I yelled at her, and she got very upset by that and started throwing things back at me too.   I left the room after that to wait for her to cool down and talk in a civilised manner, but she remained very upset even after that. We ended up giving the red packets anyway because I sought my father's advice and he said I was the AH and we should give since it is within our budget. He says I should apologize but I dont think this argument should even have been a thing in the first place if she had just listened to me. My wife and I are fine now but her throat and mine are still sore from the screaming and she has been hinting that it was my fault so aita?"

To his credit, he did snoop in my cabinet under the sink and found some Clorox wipes. He used those to wipe up what I can only figure was the visible shit. The remnants were left for me to clean. All up under the toilet lid and rim. Didn't bother to flush until it was all gone.  I want to wretch and it's been 10 hours since he left.

About 4 years ago I was very active, cheery, and would help my mom around the house, but for the past few years I have gotten depressed and realized what was wrong around me. I believe my mother is a narcissist but sometimes I wonder if it's just me. She never picks up after herself and always blames me for her messes, and also gets angry that I don't automatically start cleaning or I don't rush to do my own dishes. Maybe it's just me, but once I realized what the problem was with her I stopped wanting to do anything nice for her and lost all respect. I stay in my room constantly, which has irritated her even though it's because of her. Whenever the situation is brought up I say ""you didn't ask me to"" and her reply is ""I shouldn't have to. you should do it out of respect"" but the problem is I don't have any respect for her. What I'm asking of her (which is to ask me when she wants something done) is less than what she's asking of me (to constantly bend over backwards and clean). I get in trouble for not picking up one dish yet she leaves trash all over the house. I've tried to tell her that regardless of the situation, I tune out my surroundings and sometimes don't even notice things need cleaning but that hasn't helped, even though it's the truth. I don't want to be around her, needless to say clean up her house. And not to mention my own struggles outside of our relationship. My sister automatically cleans, but has also been through the same treatment as me. Even then, she doesn't receive credit and I don't know if it's because she's trained to do it or she's genuinely kind and I'm the bad guy. Anytime I try to talk about how I feel it's reduced down to being lazy. I don't have anywhere else to go but I'm not sure how to deal with my mother either. Help?"

My MIL and I were cool with each other but she was not a fan of his ex and did not like that they were still friends. She told me I needed to get her out of his life. I told her it’s not my place. He never gave me a reason not to trust him. I brought this up to him, whatever. Christmas came around and she gifted him a photo album of them two. I told him maybe it’s not ok to continue talking to her as she’s getting the wrong idea. He gave the album back and told her he can’t continue a friendship with her.   A couple months later he was getting ready to deploy. He was going to leave me his car to get work done on it. The appointment for body work was made for a week after he left. His mom asked to use the car after a surgery because she would have a hard time driving her car. I told her she could have it after it gets out of the body shop and after I get the oil change, brakes done, etc. She got bitchy with me and asked her son. He told her the same thing.   His moms car loan was in his name which made our DTI too high for a home loan so we ask if she could move the loan over. She said no because they were in the closing process of their house which was fine. We asked if we could do it after and she said yes. After she would say it’s not that much longer and there’s no rush.   My husband texts me saying something bothered him. It was pictures of his ex sitting next to his mom at her housewarming party. To me that was wrong because she said she’d invite me. So I let her know that I felt disrespected. She messaged my husband saying I was distant and the ex was talking to her a lot. I opened a business working a lot and she moved an hour away. She half ass apologized so I went off and let my husband deal with rest. He told her he was upset but it was up to her.   We find a house and try to get her car loan moved over to her name and she just said no. So my dad helps us.    Months later my husband starts getting depressed and wants a divorce. We didn’t speak for about 2 months.   He gets back and his mom is throwing his ex at him telling her she needs to make sure he doesn’t come back to me. They sleep together. A week later he asks if we can talk about trying to work things out. That same morning his ex tells him she’s pregnant. He doesn’t believe her and his mom gets mad that he doesn’t stay with her to take care of the baby. He tells his mom it’s him or the ex and she chose his ex.   4 years later we have a baby and he heard from her maybe 3 times since. When she was born she asked for pictures and posted them for clout.   She asks to meet her and he told her she needs to make things right with me. I just wanted her to admit what she did was wrong, no apology because I knew it would be forced. She claims to have done nothing wrong and throws a fit. I told her she was toxic.   Why do I feel bad though? Does she deserve to meet her grandchild?"

She went to visit and when she came back she told me she couldn’t be a wife anymore; back story, we have been together 10 years and married for 9. During that time she cheated 4 times &amp; the times after she cheated I cheated back, why? Because I didn’t want to be the only one feeling undesired or unloved. but I do acknowledge that instead of that toxic shit I should’ve left, but I was in love and wanted my marriage to work and she told me that she would change(spoiler:she did not) Anyways back to 2022, when she told me that she couldn’t be a wife anymore I was already suspicious that she was cheating again,she had meet a new “friend” during an out of state training that she consistently talked to and got gifts from. I figured her mom getting sick probably shook her and she wanted to re-evaluate her life, no hard feeling there, I understood but I was hurt. I still wanted to be with her and told as much. We were still living in our same house, as she had refused to let me leave for 3 months (she threatened me financially)to kinda separate myself from being her wife. During this separation we decided to work on our relationship but it was still a kind of separation… anyways I decided after 2 years of barely any sex ( 2 times in 2 years)I decided I was going to go have sex with someone who would enjoy and wanted to have sex with me. She gave me her blessing and asked for me not to bring anyone I’m dealing with to our house and I agreed because that would be super disrespectful.  During this time her new work friend was coming over, frequently despite living in another state and having 2 kids. I thought this was super weird and I was suspicious they were fooling around before this “I don’t want to be a wife” revelation but she denied it and I didn’t have proof. Flash forward to 5/4 we had been arguing over something silly. I had noticed that her “work friend” was spending the night, again (she had done so several times for a few months). I had been asking her where is her friend sleeping since her room has no room for her air mattress but they both would sleep in the room. She assured me that they slept separately. I did not believe her so on the morning of 5/5 I broke into her room to really see what was going on. As soon as I opened the door my wife hops out of bed with only her underpants on. I of course start yelling and crying because this is now the 5th time she cheated on me. I was content just to cry and yell and then I told her friend she needed to leave right now! Yet her friend didn’t move out from under the cover. I asked my wife why isn’t she leaving she told me her friend was naked. She said this sarcastically so I was like on I have to see this and pulled the cover off of her and sure enough girlie was butt naked. At that time I blacked out and hit my wife. I’m not a violent person but I don’t know I just blanked AITA?"

My sister, like everyone, has insecurities. I on the other hand, have learned to live with my insecurities and I am at peace with them. I had noticed that through her teenage years these began to grow, and she seemed angry towards me for being happy with myself.  Earlier today, I had been wearing my normal jeans and a cute tank top. I had a little bit of a muffin top up against my jeans but it wasn’t anything extreme. I was confident and comfortable, I don’t care about a bit of fat on my body, I love myself and that’s what matters. My sister saw me and proceeded to say “Why are your pants so low? Pull them up higher so you’re not spilling out. And put on a bra too, people are going to stare at you.” To preface this, I am on the autism spectrum and can’t stand certain clothes, like bras. Everyday I wear a sweater so my nipples aren’t poking through anyway, but since I was in my house I didn’t have a sweater.   Throughout the past few years she has always made comments like this but I tend to let go of things very easily if they aren’t important, like rude comments because i know they are not true. But today was my breaking point, normally I would have brushed it off but I got so mad. I got so frustrated and told her “Would you stop making me feel bad about myself when you are so clearly projecting your insecurities onto me? Mom and Dad will pay for therapy, they did with me, take it up and stop being so bitchy.” I felt really bad immediately after calling her bitchy, I apologized for that about 3 seconds after the words left my lips and told her I was just very frustrated. She insulted me with more rude comments that had nothing to do with the situation, so I simply pointed out the obvious and said “Now you’re just insulting me because you don’t know how to respond, calm down and we’ll talk when you’re ready.” This just set her off, she called me the AH and stormed off. Was what I said so bad? Should I have handled it differently?"

And then I thought, are you out of your mind? I'm a single woman.  Somebody was standing in my front yard while I was watching tv. I told him come morning I'm going for a walk. I have no problem just walking up to someone's door &amp; asking them why they were in the first place. I might be short but I've got a mighty temper. I also lack fear. When I was 12 years old the neighborhood bully walked right up to me &amp; broke my nose for no reason. After that I have fought everything in my life head on.

Shortly after that (about two weeks) I thought more people would’ve known so I asked my friend if the mutual friend was alright and they got nervous and asked how did I know so I told them I accidentally saw it on their phone. Instantly they started making sure not to tell anyone as it’s very private business and asked if I told anyone to which I said my girlfriend’s name.  Just now my friend’s boyfriend, who has known about me telling my girlfriend for a while now, lashed out on me for telling my girlfriend about the mutual friend’s mom’s passing away. He even went as far that “he has no words” and that he is “astonished” by how “awful” this whole situation is. Now I’m left questioning myself if I’m in the wrong or not.

I feel as though she should follow “girl code” and not have pursued any type of connection with him. I know that I can’t lay claim on another person but I feel like she didn’t consider my feelings in the situation. She’s supposed to have my back and could have easily just left the flirting at the party. Regardless of if I have a shot with him, should she actively try to pursue a relationship with him knowing that I was interested in him? This isn’t the first time this has happened with her in regards to pursuing someone I was interested in. She tends to date a lot and has almost cost me a friendship when she dated a friend of mine then told him I didn’t want them dating when she got tired of him.
