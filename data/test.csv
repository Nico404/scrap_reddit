Skip to today and I’m at work and I get a text ‘What are you doing leaving the tub of markers out with the lid off’ - ‘on the floor’ - ‘sort it out’ - naturally I said sorry a couple times, but thought there wasn’t any damaged caused just a baby’s ruined hope of drawing everywhere for a couple minutes.  I felt shit at this time and for maybe an hour left me feeling low, then I get another text :  ‘For having a go at you earlier . It no big deal. Not warrant of having a go. It’s the problem of you being so epic, when on the very rare time, you are not, it’s a shock x x x’  I made a couple texts about food for dinner sounding excited at her ideas then responded to the above text with: ‘I know babe, and you dropped her on her head so I get a few free passes 😂💋’ - ‘love u babe x x’   She replied : ‘when did I drop her on her head?’ - and I replied ‘when she fell down the stairs, I’m not blaming you babe x’   - now we’re home she said I upset her saying that and when I said I didn’t mean literally blame her for doing it she exploded saying I had been ‘bottling it up’, ‘always have to have the last word’  Bit of backstory, I feel she always overreacts to issues in a hyper emotional way which generally is angry or at least petty and vindictive and I’m the total opposite character, very introvert and try to empathise but can be aloof to some emotive situations. We had a discussion about this where she said ‘I can’t not be angry’ and I said ‘negative things will stick with me 10x longer than any positive praise’ so we agreed to be mindful  My POV: I know the joke was kinda crass, but that’s always been my humour and I admit it sometimes doesn’t work- I leave some pens out and it’s ‘sort your life out’, but I appreciate she realised that and apologised, my reply was to say even tho she dropped our daughter down the stairs I didn’t get angry because I knew she felt guilty anyway and it could have been either of us, plus   I just want some balance in how we speak to each other. Now she won’t talk to me saying I’m ‘having the last word’, making up ‘hypothetical situations’ about if the roles/situations were reversed. I know if I had let her drop down the stairs I would have got a real bitter demeaning talking to and not any empathy or pragmatism and it’s making me sad the more and more it goes on with each example over the years   Maybe I am the A?"

I had a issue with this one math tutor before and i told my mom i no longer wanted to work with him. He always tried to act rude with me when i asked him for help and he would constantly try to avoid helping me by giving me sarcastic responses. He always sounds tired too like if he doesn’t want to work.   So today i had him as my tutor again. Everything was fine. Then i was stuck in this one math question and i asked him for help.   Tutor: What do you need help with  Me: I don’t understand this question (I circled the question for him)  Tutor: What don’t you understand?  Me: (i repeated it again) I don’t understand this question and what to exactly do.   Tutor: What aren’t you understanding you know what a quadrilateral and a parrallel is so idk what you aren’t understanding   Me: i still don’t really understand it the words don’t really help much even with me knowing them   Tutor: Do you not know how to read?   This is when i got absolutely ticked off and i told him in a normal tone  “Listen man i already reported you before for doing this same sarcastic rude crap to me and i’m trying to get help from this and you are refusing to help me cuz you’re assuming that i know this i don’t want to continue working with you if you’re gonna continue being disrespectful with me Are you gonna help me or do i need to get a new tutor”  He then tells me something that i forgot and he says if i’m gonna continue being disresptful and that he will report me as well . He then continues talking and at this point i didn’t care anymore and i just told him sorry and during that he muted himself and left the chat room. He later came back and i told him that i already told my mom about him and that i’m waiting for another tutor And that i don’t want to work with him anymore.   He says that it’s fine and that he reported me as well and that i was being disresptful and I told him that i said sorry to him earlier but he decided to leave and he told me if i was the one in the right then why did i say sorry and i told him it was just because i wanted to get this argument over with and litterally just finish myhomework cu my time was almost up for tutoring. He just told me if i’m gonna continue being disresptful and i told him fine i’m sorry. Honeslty i shouldn’t have said sorry cuz i don’t think i was in the wrong What do you guys think."

I felt really bad for my friend because they were perfect for each other.  So they had obviously been on and off and recently she had cut him off which was a very smart decision he had completely messed up here mental health.  recently i found from one of my other friends that he got head from another girl whilst talking to her. i was in total shock but what can i say his a uk boy  there's no explanation.  today she called me and she told me but i told her i already new and i remind you that's shes still talking to him and he is coming to her house this weekend.  i do feel like shit for not telling her but i wanted her to find out herself I'm not in no position to tell her. i felt like he could've manned up and told her but he didn't.

Partner wastes the whole day if upset,1,1674513859,"We are both really broke right now. They have more earning potential than me but have been out of a job and are in a debt hole. I'm trying to go back to school, and we are in the process of starting a business and working on some educational material that down the line should be able to make money. I live in their house so I could consolidate my expenses and have been paying for pretty much everything since we've been together, with the exception of rent and their bills which i've only paid once. They usually get their parents to bail us out, before that we were on rent relief. I had a min wage job which I lost but it was pretty thankless anyway and monopolized my time.  They often spend the whole day doing random things around the house, or on social media arguing with people. They do do things to move us forward but its the exception rather than the rule.  A big issue is that every time we have any fight or disagreement or anything, they respond by doing nothing at all until it's resolved. Meanwhile I plug away at the things I'm supposed to do. We have a shared to-do-list with our group tasks and individual tasks. In the week we have had it they have gotten zero individual tasks completed.  When they are happy, and we are good, they can be very productive. But they get derailed at the slightest discontent and flat out refuse to do any work at all. It stressed me out to no end because it's my money that is draining into their debt hole. I told them this today and they said I should try to actually resolve issues and not stress them out, that I am causing an emotional mess and I should clean it up. I know I'm not perfect and I get upset, and could be better at communication and also that even on a good day I often distract them or otherwise hold them back. It's just such a thankless cycle that they give up so easily. They spent the entire day two days ago on twitter instead of doing any basic task on their list.  AITA?"
