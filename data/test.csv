Skip to today and I’m at work and I get a text ‘What are you doing leaving the tub of markers out with the lid off’ - ‘on the floor’ - ‘sort it out’ - naturally I said sorry a couple times, but thought there wasn’t any damaged caused just a baby’s ruined hope of drawing everywhere for a couple minutes.  I felt shit at this time and for maybe an hour left me feeling low, then I get another text :  ‘For having a go at you earlier . It no big deal. Not warrant of having a go. It’s the problem of you being so epic, when on the very rare time, you are not, it’s a shock x x x’  I made a couple texts about food for dinner sounding excited at her ideas then responded to the above text with: ‘I know babe, and you dropped her on her head so I get a few free passes 😂💋’ - ‘love u babe x x’   She replied : ‘when did I drop her on her head?’ - and I replied ‘when she fell down the stairs, I’m not blaming you babe x’   - now we’re home she said I upset her saying that and when I said I didn’t mean literally blame her for doing it she exploded saying I had been ‘bottling it up’, ‘always have to have the last word’  Bit of backstory, I feel she always overreacts to issues in a hyper emotional way which generally is angry or at least petty and vindictive and I’m the total opposite character, very introvert and try to empathise but can be aloof to some emotive situations. We had a discussion about this where she said ‘I can’t not be angry’ and I said ‘negative things will stick with me 10x longer than any positive praise’ so we agreed to be mindful  My POV: I know the joke was kinda crass, but that’s always been my humour and I admit it sometimes doesn’t work- I leave some pens out and it’s ‘sort your life out’, but I appreciate she realised that and apologised, my reply was to say even tho she dropped our daughter down the stairs I didn’t get angry because I knew she felt guilty anyway and it could have been either of us, plus   I just want some balance in how we speak to each other. Now she won’t talk to me saying I’m ‘having the last word’, making up ‘hypothetical situations’ about if the roles/situations were reversed. I know if I had let her drop down the stairs I would have got a real bitter demeaning talking to and not any empathy or pragmatism and it’s making me sad the more and more it goes on with each example over the years   Maybe I am the A?"

I'm trying to go back to school, and we are in the process of starting a business and working on some educational material that down the line should be able to make money. I live in their house so I could consolidate my expenses and have been paying for pretty much everything since we've been together, with the exception of rent and their bills which i've only paid once. They usually get their parents to bail us out, before that we were on rent relief. I had a min wage job which I lost but it was pretty thankless anyway and monopolized my time.  They often spend the whole day doing random things around the house, or on social media arguing with people. They do do things to move us forward but its the exception rather than the rule.  A big issue is that every time we have any fight or disagreement or anything, they respond by doing nothing at all until it's resolved. Meanwhile I plug away at the things I'm supposed to do. We have a shared to-do-list with our group tasks and individual tasks. In the week we have had it they have gotten zero individual tasks completed.  When they are happy, and we are good, they can be very productive. But they get derailed at the slightest discontent and flat out refuse to do any work at all. It stressed me out to no end because it's my money that is draining into their debt hole. I told them this today and they said I should try to actually resolve issues and not stress them out, that I am causing an emotional mess and I should clean it up. I know I'm not perfect and I get upset, and could be better at communication and also that even on a good day I often distract them or otherwise hold them back. It's just such a thankless cycle that they give up so easily. They spent the entire day two days ago on twitter instead of doing any basic task on their list.  AITA?"

We live together and share everything someone could share with someone. We talk about everything and do everything in front of each other, and even with eachother (cuddling, having sex, trying new fetishes etc.) So far, so good - now the problem: I am a monogamous person who shows love and affection through physical touch and i only do that with special people and it means a lot to me. I don't feel the need to be affectionate with random people, i even feel repulsed by the thought. My best friend however is polyarmor and enjoys sex with random people, most of them are damn wierd ones with a problematic personality. She even jokes about them most of the time. The whole time i am close to her i feel unwell in my stomach when thinking about it and i can't relax properly whenever we get intimate and i never knew why exactly. I believed i was just jealous, but i felt well when she only had one special person besides me she got intimate with. After a lot of thinking i got to the point, that my love language of physical touch had no worth in that context, due to her doing all that with whoever came into her life and it lost all meaning. I feel like one out of many in that regard and it hurts a lot, her way of living is so different of mine that it wierds me out. If you get a flower by someone that only few will ever see, it feels special, but get a flower like everyone else just entering the house and you will loose all interest in it, at least thats the way i feel.

I have a soon-to-be sister-in-law that is having an upcoming June wedding. Now my brother in laws fiancée is famously a brat. We once got along, but since her engagement, that has changed. I fear for my sheep-like brother-in-law’s life, but hey, you’re not allowed to say that directly to them, right? I shall call her Bridezilla henceforth. Bridezilla is in her late 20s, has a higher paying job than I (a woman in her 30s), and pays ZERO BILLS because she chooses to live with her parents in their mansion and has no student loans. Needless to say, her perception of reality doesn’t align with real-life or real-life problems. To be polite, she has been nothing short of a manically deceptive b-word. Ensuring we know this event is a six-figure wedding and will be black tie. Part of her six-figure wedding includes no children. Bridezilla took it upon herself to hire a babysitter to watch guests’ children on the compound. This includes my sister-in-law of a decade (we get along superbly, and I love her like my own sister). Her husband (AKA my other brother-in-law) is a part of the groom’s party. I knew from the day Bridezilla told me she was planning this that it would be a huge issue. I know this because my sister-in-law is the definition of a Mama Bear (which I will call her for story clarity). Mama Bear has NEVER been apart from her many children. No one watches them, including her own mother! So, when I heard some random person would be sitting, I did not say a word to either of them. I am, again, staying way out of it as much as possible. Well, recently, Bridezilla took it upon herself to tell Mama Bear this was the deal. Mama Bear made it VERY clear to Bridezilla that there is no way she isn’t attending without her children. Even when Bridezilla told her to at least make the ceremony since kids are allowed there, Mama Bear will not drive up with a van full of kids, which would include a 9 hours’ drive just for the ceremony. Bridezilla was so furious she expected me to take her side and agree Mama Bear was out of line. So here I am dealing with two people with strong personalities who want opposing things. Why does this impact me? Well, my husband is also a member of the groom’s party, and recently she asked me to do a reading at the reception (something I’m genuinely dreading because the joy of this event has been zapped out of me). It felt like she asked me as her way of trying to apologize for her outburst (without actually having to say sorry), but it also felt like it was a sort of alliance thing. I dread doing this and don’t drink, so libations will not get me through this event. Am I the asshole for wanting to decline the invite to do the reading, even though I hold no grudge against my sheep-like-bro-in-law who was also on the call when she asked? Anyway, thanks for letting me spew this to the digital space, and please, wish me luck surviving that weekend."

I emphasized that I’m not saying I wish he was upset, I just wish he’d come to me when he was.   He immediately rejected my offer of maybe just sitting down and talking about everything and said that they are his feelings and if he wants to talk about them with me he will, but if he doesn’t he doesn’t.   I suppose I understand that but I am very hurt. I struggle with being a people person, so the fact that I can’t help him and he doesn’t want my help really hurt.

A little back story tidbit my grandpa cheated on my grandma through out their entire relationship and marriage, he even had about 6 kids during that time. Especially one that is only 2 years older then me. I found out that my grandpa on my moms side used to have sexual relations with my aunt/Cuzin who isn’t blood related to him but by marriage through my grandmother( her brother). I found out that this was going on for years and only stopped when my grandma kicked my aunt and her sister (twins) out the house when I was about 12. Now here’s the thing he likes to take my daughter a lot, shower her or with her, ask to sleep with her at night even taking pictures and videos of her and with her that I didn’t know of until he post them to FB without my consent or when I go through his phone gallery to help him post photos and videos for him. He’s NEVER done this with any of his grandchildren. My aunts and uncle wouldn’t let him/ them take or post pictures nor video on social media of their kids. After finding all of this out and knowing past family secrets/ history I started distancing me and my daughter from them, I wouldn’t let him keep her for more then 5 minutes 10 tops when I’m not on their presence and would barely give her to him.

He was 26 or so at the time, I was about 20 (F). We wound up breaking up (he was driving me nuts for things irrelevant to this story). I wound up meeting my soul mate literally a WEEK after. At the time, my soul mate was about 23 (M).  My ex decided that we couldn't even be friends for a little bit because he was p\*\*\*\*d about me immediately falling for this other guy. I was like fine, whatever. Kinda being an a\*\* about it.  Fast forward 3 years. My BF asked me to marry him (yay me!) and we're getting married this fall. I am incidentally still friends with my ex. We resolved things after about a year. At first, he still hated my fiance's guts but that's his problem.  Here is where I might be the AH. My ex recently got together with this chick, let's call her AJ. I met her very briefly and got some pretty weird vibes from her. Turns out she was married before to some guy she never met. A little foggy about those details. I told my friend that she was a bit off to me and I didn't know if he should date her. Like really, major weird vibes. Plus, she's 32, doesn't have a job, doesn't have a place, and doesn't have a car... It's not really my business but he IS still my friend and I care for him very deeply.   Well, turns out that a\*\* told her EVERYTHING I said about her. Very dumb. But, it TURNS OUT she had some pretty nasty (and unwarranted) things to say about me! She told him (which he told me) that she felt like I was just keeping him around for when my fiance inevitably left me and needed a rebound man.  Like, the f\*\*\*????  Let's be clear, this guy is one of my best friends, I love him to pieces, but NOT LIKE THAT! I'm very much in love with my fiance.   SO, to the point, I'm getting married.

I told my BF he could take my friend on a “date” while I was gone but on the condition that he could not kiss her because I was not there and I wasn’t ready for that yet, which I communicated to him. Our relationship with each other (all three of us) has been entirely based on open communication, communicating our needs and wants we want to come out of our situationship. Well the date never happened my friend didn’t respond to his advance that I consented to. 2 weeks after, Me and my BF moved out of the country to stay in Costa Rica for 3 months which we have been planning for a year. so we pretty much all three agreed we would put this on pause for the time being and reevaluate when we get back. Well me and my boyfriend have an open phone policy where we can poke around if we do choose and after months of not going through his phone, I got curious. On apple messages there is a feature where you can see if they deleted any messages in the last thirty days, I saw he had deleted 2 messages in him and my bestfriends chat and I recovered it and looked at the messages and he was sexting her (although she did not reciprocate at all) texts like “I’m getting in the shower, I wish you were here” “I want to fuck you” and a few more. I was immediately appalled. I did not consent to this, he never communicated it to me, and the time stamps was when I was in a different state. I am so pissed at him. Am I the asshole?"

She’s just let him but every convo she has she finds a way to bring him up, she will call him names with “rizz” in it, and overall find every excuse to talk to him. This girl, let’s call her Susan, knows I have a big crush on the guy, call him Carl, and still chooses to act overly friendly to him. I understand Susan wanting to just be really nice and friendly but a lot of outside friends are pointing out small things Susan does aimed at Carl and tell me that Susan is “obviously flirting.” So seeing that I’ve started to notice and feel as if that’s what is happening as well. The past month I have become extremely and unreasonably jealous of Susan acting like this towards Carl who she knows I really like and trust (long separate other story) more than anyone else I’ve tried talking to. Well now for the main part of this, I told Carl how I felt about Susan and what I’ve noticed and that I understand I have no right to be upset or feel this way but I just needed to talk about it. His responses were fairly dry and he said that susan is just a good friend I shouldn’t worry about especially since everyone talks about him as jokes. I’m not going to lie that kinda made me feel a bit worse and like I was borderline obsessively overthinking the situation. My other friends Id let know said i had a normal reaction to this and that I’m not losing my marbles but I still feel like an asshole and just shitty. I guess my question here is, ATAH for thinking my Susan would do such a thing and am I crazy for any of this?   TLDR: I thought my friend was flirting with the guy I like and so I ranted to him about it but now I feel like an asshole and I’ve just fully lost my shit."

So ive been sitting on this decision for a while now. Basically, my gf's family is going on a cruise over spring break and they wanted me to come. We are both seniors so this is our last spring break of college. I decided not to go because of these reasons:  1. They are offering to pay for half so I would have to drop around $300-400 and I am just not a big cruise guy so it isnt too exciting to me to have to spend that much on something I do not really wanna do  2. I wanted to see my family for a few days because once I graduate (I am a senior) life will be getting busy and idk if I will be able to come home much. Our school is 12 hours away from my home while her house is about 30 minutes away from our school so I dont know if she really understands the feelings I have about this. She can see her family everyday while I see them every so often. i miss them a lot especially since my parents are getting older (in their mid-late 60s) and my grandma is old (about to turn 88). This time with them is valuable to me.  3. I will have homework over break for sure and idk if i could do it on a 10 day cruise.  4. They go on a cruise every year, so when its not my last spring break of college I can go.  5. My friend visited my school and I have talked about visiting him since freshman year and this is honestly the last chance I can get at visiting him.  Anyways, she is pretty dissapointed and mad at me beacuse her sisters bf is coming on the trip and so is her brothers gf. This makes a lot of sense to me but overall I think I just can not go. I am trying to be nice about it and I sent a long text to her dad saying how grateful I am for the invite but that I can not go on the trip. Am I an asshole for this?"

My MIL asked my kid if she wanted to join BEFORE speaking to me about it and of course my LO said yes. I was upset about this because as her parents I should've been consulted first. I initially said no because it wasn't something I could afford even with my husband and I working. MIL stated she would be the one to cover the cost. I still said I didn't think it was a good idea because if she could no longer cover it going forward it wasn't something I could afford to take over. She stated that wouldn't be an issue and practically begged for me to let my daughter join. I caved and said fine. SIL recently bought a house and MIL is moving in with her and told me she can no longer pay for the classes so I either have to pull her or pay for them myself. I just had a baby and am on unpaid maternity leave so were currently scraping by on one income while trying to save enough to move due to my landlord selling  the house we live in.  My daughter is going to be crushed when I break the news to her and I'm livid because had they not gone behind my back, and consulted me first, I would have said no just in case something like this came up. They have the habit of asking my daughter if she wants to do things before asking me and I feel like it's a complete overstep of boundaries and disrespectful towards me as her mother because when I'm not able to do the thing they asked her about, I have to be the one to let her down. My husband said I shouldn't be upset because it's not her fault she can't afford it anymore but I'm tired of having to disappoint my child because they go behind my back with things like this. So AITA"

We were close until he got with his girlfriend. He has a tendency to make stupid decisions which lead to him being emotionally damaged. In order to be able to make sure he doesn’t make one of those stupid decisions I wanted to make friends with his girlfriend.  Bit of context. Me and my cousin always have been there for each other. If one of us was in trouble the other would be there in a matter of minutes. No matter how busy we were.  My cousin get attached to people easily. Which ends up hurting him in the long run. He’s has his fair amount of toxic exes and I’ve always been there to support him and protect him if needed.  In this particular case he asked me to reach out to her when they first got involved so I could help him if he needed it.  So today I went to message her and as soon as I did it blew up in my face and I’m being made to look like the bad guy. So Reddit I’m coming to you and trust you that you will tell me if ITA for trying to protect someone who I’m close to.

It's considered a miracle that she is alive. My Grandma raised her with a healthy lifestyle and she never strayed from it. She is known within the family to be obsessed with our health. She gives advice to everyone she believes needs it &amp; she is very persistent about it.  I'm 26 &amp; my weight always fluctuates between a high average &amp; above average bmi since I was young. My aunt would take me to the side many times to express worry over my eating habits &amp; give me advice. I started telling her I don't care about my health at 14 &amp; sometimes she goes to my mom instead. Since I moved out, I see my aunt less &amp; I just ignore her messages if it is unsolicited advice or articles about health. Sometimes, during family gatherings, she'll ask to talk to alone but I just shrug her off &amp; make sure I'm not alone with her.  The last family gathering, I brought home my bf for the first time. My aunt messaged me before saying she has something important to talk to me about in person. I knew what it was &amp; just ignored her message. She asked again when I greeted her &amp; I said whatever she wants to say can wait.   After dinner we were all chatting in the living room &amp; my aunt said something like ""I want to talk to you in the kitchen for a minute"". I flat out said no in front of everyone. A minute later she starts talking about weight &amp; sedentary lifestyles and how dangerous they are. Then she looks at me &amp; says ""I know it hard to start but it's important, if not for the person themselves, for their kids"". After that she speaks to me directly &amp; says ""I'm sure you wouldn't like that for your future kids &amp; it's easier to start now before they are here"".   I was shocked, disgusted &amp; very embarrassed (mostly because my bf was there for the first time). I said the first thing that I always thought &amp; I know everyone does but were all too polite to say. I said something like ""You're the last person to talk about health. Ever thought why the most obsessed with health has been the unhealthiest out of all of us by a mile? Maybe you are doing something wrong, not any of us!"". She immediately started sobbing &amp; everyone was trying to comfort her. I told my bf we should leave.  My mom hasn't talked to me about this and I don't want to either. Plenty of my family contacted me saying what I said was really horrible &amp; no matter how nosy, she didn't deserve what I said. They want me to apologize but I'm not sorry for what I said because honestly, she needed to hear it. As a family we tried saying ""okay"" to her constant unsolicited advice, we tried debating her, we tried ignoring her &amp; saying we don't want to hear what she has to say about our health. Nothing worked &amp; I have a feeling this will. Saying sorry &amp; that I was wrong will just make her continue meddling &amp; being extremely nosy &amp; offensive.  I feel like they're too biased &amp; pity her, so I want objective opinions. AITA for what I said?"

I wouldn't care if my jewelry box was only jewelry but it had my grandparents ashes in it (my dad's parents), my mom said it's my fault for leaving and that I'm just being an ahole for causing a fuss about her going through my stuff and cleaning my room which I just cleaned on Friday and came home to it destroyed.   so I'm just wondering AITA for being angry at my mom offering my room to her friends daughter when I told my mom I didn't even want her spending the night, and cleaning my room and sanitizing because she had ring worm?"

So backstory out of the way now I can get into the part where I might be the asshole. One day my dad took me to his house after we went to target and when I walk in I see the woman he cheated with (let’s call her Olivia). Olivia is a raging alcoholic, has been in and out of rehab and the mental hospital multiple times, she used to be my parents friend from collage she even has her own kid and husband but her alcoholism has completely ruined her family.So Olivia is sitting on the couch and I see her and I just freeze, I mean I’ve only seen a picture of her once and I never thought my dad would introduce me to her. She sees me and says “Hi I’m Olivia” I look her dead in the eyes and say “so you’re the alcoholic slut who ruined my family?” She gets a little frozen too and is like “what??” And after that I keep calling her names bitch being the best of them. My dad of course gets mad and takes me home to my moms house. Of course I tell my mom and she honestly wasn’t mad she just said that I shouldn’t say things like that but she wasn’t mad that I said those things to Olivia. My dad has been texting me saying that I I was completely out of line and that he was furious with me for saying those things to her. I’m starting to think that I shouldn’t have said that but I’m also not sorry I said those things at all. So am I the Asshole?"

My younger brother (12M) and I (16F) have been close all our life but not so long ago he has been acting strange around me.  One day while I was going out with my friends I had left my keys on my desk so I had to go back to my room. However when entering my bedroom I saw my brother searching for something in my drawers. I dont remember what he was trying to find but I remember finding it strange since I only put my underwear there and he usually ask for permission when he need something from my room.  But it's not the only strange thing he did. Like I said, him and I are really close but since he's becoming older I find it weird how he still ask for hugs and always want to sit near me. Usually boys his age thinks girls are boring so it kinda shock me how clingy he is toward me.  But today when I hugged him, his face went straight at my breast. It embarrassed me but I thought that its probably just an accident. When I tried to make the hug end he only pushed his face further. That's when I got angry and told him to quit it.  I ran to my room not wanting to stay with him after what he did, but after a while, I feel awful for getting angry at him... Am I in the wrong?"
