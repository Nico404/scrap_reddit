10p0glu,AITA for saying my mother is insensitive for calling her new partner her soulmate?,1004,"I’m 21F, recently welcomed my own child into the world and I’ve been pretty emotional since.My mother always encouraged me to express myself, be independent and got me into things like art and swimming, we were super close. My dad wasn’t amazing towards my mother; he decided who she saw, what she ate and how she dressed but they separated when I was 12, and his behaviour didn’t change how he treated me because he was a great dad…up till I was 16 and he passed away he was still trying to rekindle his relationship with my mother and still trying to improve via therapy, I know it wasn’t her job to forgive him but my dad fully believed she was his soulmate, and up till his death he was apologising and trying to get better for her.Four years ago my mother got with “Candice” and came out as bi, she said her parents wouldn’t have accepted her but now she has nobody to hide from…I would’ve accepted it, but then two years ago they had a son, and they’re talking about another child, I did ask my mother if she felt a little old to be bringing another child in this world younger than her granddaughter and she said, in front of my husband and in laws, that “you’re never too old when you’re with your soulmate” I did get upset, I said that’s a little insensitive when she never considered my father her soulmate - considering everything he always tried to get better for her, to support her and that even if she didn’t believe that she shouldn’t have said that in front of her child, especially when she’s been with Candice for 4 years versus first love/ 15 years she was with my dad, she went silent and the meal was awkward.My husband apologised on my behalf, I told him not to, my mothers new partner called me a “massive narcissistic asshole” and left.AITA?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10p0glu/aita_for_saying_my_mother_is_insensitive_for/
10p55w6,AITA for having my adult daughter pay half of rent.,462,"I [52F] am having my adult daughter [25F] pay half of rent. My daughter moved in with me in 2019, graduated from university and got her own job in 2022, and continues to live with me, but has her own adult job lives her own life. I have asked her to split the cost of rent and utilities in half with me. She has repeatedly told me that she should be saving her money for a down payment on a house, or for her education which she plans to continue, and doesn’t consider it fair that she is splitting the cost of living in half with me. For context, we live in a high cost of living area and she is not able to move out on her own. Additionally, our rent is below average cost for our area. I know she does not want to live with me but she has not been able to find a space she can afford. AITA for making her split 50/50?I am adding this to the main post since it was suggested: I think it is important to mention that she does not bring people over ever as she is “embarrassed” at the state of the house. This has been a common fight between us as well. She has asked me to get rid of things so she can make space for her items and I have not done so yet, as am I very tired from work and find it hard to clean up when I come home.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10p55w6/aita_for_having_my_adult_daughter_pay_half_of_rent/
