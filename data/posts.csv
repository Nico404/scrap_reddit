The shifts starts out normal me and miya were joking around about something that happened outside of work and I have a hard laugh when I think something is funny, it sounds like weizing so simon made fun of it asking if i had an asthma atttack and then said I sound like a donkey, then whenever I laugh he would make a donkey noise, and side note I genuenily hate this laugh and try not to laugh that much becasue of that reason. So I thought out of spite I'm not gonna say one word and see how long it takes for him to notice an half and hour goes by (miya was timing it) and I had a whole convo without saying anything HE EVEN ANSWERED A QUESTION FOR ME I DIDN'T SAY ONE WORD. Then we tell katie and she tells simon that theres something going on that hes not noticing, 50 minute mark now and hes comes up to me cuz he found out it had been that long and asks if its my hair and all this stuff, they kept saying no and I kept straight facing him. 1 hour mark we tell Lexi and she laughs in his face, cuz she saw me having a ""convo"" with him SHE NOTCIED I WASN""T SAYING ANYTHING FOR IT. Then she starts to make fun of him for it being like ""wow you really havent notcied thats sad"" he proceeded to call me annoying and the situation was obnocious. Then it being slow, no customers, we were all in a circle and he goes ""I don't know what it could be its not her hair, I noticed things about her, I talk to her all the time, I listen to her"" thats were the shift lost it. We kept derek out only cuz him and simon are friends and we knew he would tell him. now at 1 hour 30 mins, I was gonna tell him at one hour but then he called me annoying thats the only reason I let it go on that long he also said at one point that he probably doesn;t care enough about it. I told him and he said ""ok? you really expect me to notice that I'm manger and have a job going on"" I did apolgize and stuff he said ""It doesnt matter its not gonna change anything"" and for the whole rest of the shift he would yell at me if anything got messed up even if it wasn't me or to clean things over and over again.

I moved out of her house about a year ago because she was always negative around me, and I just didn't like being with her. She was negative for understandable reasons, though. She works constantly. So when she's off, she becomes way too needy for attention. She wanted at least and hour every day to spend time with me and i just didn't care for it because talking to her was like talking to a sergeant. You just cant have your own opinion. She even kept wanting me to rub her feet and put lotion on unspeakable places. So yeah, I moved out.  Over the past year, my father (her ex), my dog, and my aunt (on her side) had died. She was becoming increasingly lonely and in need of attention. She didn't beg, instead demanded, that I visit her every week. I chose a place over an hour away too just get away from her (and because that was what was available at the time). I actually work for her for her business and really don't like it. I hate filing, doing quickbooks, while also having to listen to her and wait for her instructions every time I work for her. At least I have a second job because this also isn't a reliable source of income.   I see her every week and to also help her out with her company but I'm dreading going to be with her (especially the 1 hour 15 minute drive) so I'm thinking bout quitting and pursuing other things.

It is a party for young people around my son's age, not the type of event you would invite your family. Even if she is technically a legal adult, she is still in high school and I don't feel she is mature enough for a setting like that. She is generally a shy and introvert girl with a small social circle of friends, never having show big interest for parties before this one. I offered her alternatives of things we could do with his brother to celebrate his birthday at other moment besides that party, like going to Disneyland, that she would have generally be interested in but this time she was not receptive to what I was saying.  She promised that she would behave very well and would not drink alcohol or act improperly in any way. She also argued my position was unfair for her because some of her friends from school were also invited and were going to attend. I didn't think that argument had any value because it is not my fault her friends have bad parents that don't protect their daughters as well as me. I am also somewhat skeptical of the details of that claim because, even though I don't doubt high school girls will likely be in attendance, the small number of close friends my daughter has are not precisely the type that gets invited to this kind of events. She has been really acting angry about this and being cold towards me when usually I am her favorite person in the world.  Am I the Asshole?"

We are in our early twenties now. She has clearly had a hard life and I will never understand how it feels to have no parental figures. But here is where I have the problem.  At least twice a day she will bring up that her parents are dead or that she's been ""abandoned"". Whenever she has an inconvenience day to day she says things like ""I didn't need this today  I have enough to cry about with my parents being dead"". She's even brought up that doing the dishes is traumatic for her because she used to do them with her family (she is always leaving dishes in the sink and that was her response when I brought it up).  She brings up this trauma everyday and her personality trait is being ""the girl with the dead parents"". Even in situations where she is clearly in the wrong she tries to justify her actions as a trauma response because her parents are dead. She isn't in any sort of therapy even though I have brought it help and said it may help her process how she's feeling, but she said she has tried it and it doesn't work.  I don't really know what to do at this point, it sucks because I don't even enjoy being around her anymore because she is so negative and I genuinely don't know what I can say or do to help her.  It is really emotionally draining for me to have to hear about how her life sucks everyday especially when she won't take any of my advice on how she could be happier!  Am I the asshole if I tell her she need to stop using her dead parents as an excuse for everything and that she need to take accountability for her actions and try to live a better life?

I have done this ever since I moved off to college. And this year, that day was yesterday.  Now, normally on these days, my wife will leave me alone and find something to do, but her car was in the shop, and she had a trip planned and was going to the beach with her friends.  So the day before yesterday I told her I was willing to take her and her friends and drop them off at the beach, thinking it would be a short trip.  Except, it turns out that it was much farther away than I previously had thought, and there was a ton of traffic, so the trip ended up taking almost 3 hours. And the worst part of it was that her and her friends were very loud, rambunctious, and obnoxious throughout the drive, singing songs and chatting. And I couldn’t say anything or stand up for myself because I had to be quiet, so as a result, my day of silence ended up getting ruined. Furthermore I had to pick them up so more of my time was wasted and ruined, and I couldn’t think clearly as a result.   This morning, I was really mad at my wife and I yelled at her. I told her that she had betrayed me and took advantage of me by not telling her friends to maintain a quiet environment in the drive and respect my day of silence especially since I was doing them a favor, and she replied that she shouldn’t have to and what I’m asking for is ridiculous. Now she’s not talking to me unless I apologize for blowing up on her. AITA?"

He was venting to me a lot and I felt really bad for not being there for him, and my mom eventually called me downstairs because someone in our neighborhood had been triggering some bad memories she’d had with substances. I was busy and didn’t really know how to respond so I kept giving her one word responses and I eventually told her that I really needed to go upstairs and she told me that I was being narcissistic and that she was my mom and she should come first, she’s been acting weird all week and today she told me she felt like she found out that I didn’t care about her.

So my sisters “best friend “ (let’s call her Ashley) let us stay at her house until we could find something better. I’ve resolved my living situation and my sister is still staying with Ashley. But anyway while I was living there Ashley would mistreat me a lot she’d talk a lot of shit about me to my own sister when I wouldn’t even bother her that day and would yell at me about certain things that didn’t really matter. She constantly put wedge between me and my sister. She’d sometimes rough play with me thinking it was okay because I’d do it with my sister because we would horseplay like siblings do (yes we are both adults but it’s still funny sometimes). She would constantly call me ugly and apparently my sister too, but if I even tried to joke like that back with her I was in the wrong. When my sister would hang out with her boyfriend Ashley would then try to be nice and hangout with me cause my sister wasn’t there.   One thing she did that really pissed me off was there was a whole week when Ashley was constantly talking shit and complaining about me to my own sister so she had enough of it and told Ashley straight up if she had an issue with me say it to me instead of her and Ashley didn’t like that so she threw a tantrum and made my sister look like the one in the wrong to me started talking shit about my sister to ME.   Another thing she did that irked me was I was talking with this guy I met on bumble a lot and Ashley could hear it from the other room and would sometimes intrude and start talking with him. Sometimes she’d see I was texting him and literally snatch my phone from my hands and text him back. She also constantly told him how she tried finding him bumble but never did and constantly tried to get me to invite him to things. And turns out she was jealous of me because my sister told me so. I really don’t get how you are jealous of a guy you don’t know but whatever.   Now after finally leaving her house I fully told my sister how I felt about Ashley and why I won’t get along with her and my sister admitted to me several things Ashley has done to her over the course of ten years. I won’t get into it because it’s not my business to share. But lately when Ashley has tried talking with me and trying to hang out with me but I really just kept my distance and I think she’s noticing. My sister tells me I shouldn’t hold such a resentment towards her because she let me live with her but I don’t know just because she did sometime nice doesn’t excuse all the other bullshit she put me through but I’m really not sure am I in the wrong?"

We later decided to term the man Top Gun Guy because he got outraged and started yelling in my friend’s face like he was a drill sergeant. I got the feeling Top Gun Guy was a loser with no accomplishments in life apart from his ability to throw a ball down a lane. Top Gun Guy yelled and yelled about how my friend ruined his “streak” and wouldn’t take “I’m sorry” and “it was an accident” for an answer. Finally, the security guy came and kicked Top Gun Guy out. After he left, we decided to terrorize his girlfriend, who stayed to finish the game. We yelled “choke” when she was throwing her ball and later we started intentionally throwing our balls in her gutter in order to tank her score. When we did that, the security guy came back and kicked us all out.    When I told my dad about this, I expected him to congratulate me.

He would have 'manic episodes' where he'd act erratically. I don't want to overshare, but for reference, the worst episode ended with him destroying the house and all the electronics inside of it with a hammer and getting taken to the psychiatric hospital by police, which wasn't super fun for anyone. He was in and out of psych wards for several years, but he's been in remission for a year or so.    This resulted in some complicated (lmao) feelings towards him. The thing is that before his illness, he was a pretty good dad. I was really lucky - he was a successful businessman and I got to grow up in a nice neighborhood and I never missed out on opportunities.    I know it's unfair for me to not like him because of an illness that was completely beyond his control. It feels like things should be better since he's in remission now but it still feels like shit. It feels like he never puts any effort into things that aren't directly beneficial to him (for example: he blew up when asked if he could help with washing the dishes). So I try to minimize contact with him because even just seeing him makes me immediately feel angry and sad.  He doesn't hit me anymore but he shouts a lot and says some really terrible things to my mom. It seems really ungrateful considering that she's literally dedicated her entire existence to taking care of him. All of these factors make me feel constantly upset and scared even though I shouldn't.   I don't pick fights with my dad. My brother straight up hates him so they clash more often. And I know that it's immature, but whenever my dad needs my help with something it pisses me off. For example if he asks me to fold his laundry I'll grit my teeth and do it, even though I really don't want to. I'm not gonna yell at him but I know I'm not being an angel either. My mom says that I shouldn't be upset at him for having an illness that's beyond his control. She also points out that it's his money that's enabling me and my brother to go to therapy. And she's right. Mental illness can really screw you over, and my dad's just as much a victim as everyone else. I can't pretend to love him but I also feel like I'm being mean and ungrateful.   In the end, I feel really conflicted because part of me says that my dad could be doing more despite his illness, but part of me also says that I'm being ungrateful and immature in hating him for something that he didn't ask for. Please be honest and give me a reality check, am I being the asshole? Thanks a lot for taking the time to read all of this!"

During the phone call my father asks me why I'm so interested in working;  I say, ""Because I like having money to spend.""  Him, ""Oh, I know that. Your bank account really says a lot. What did you  spend all of this money on, anyway? Right now you don't have a cent.""  **Keep in mind, he is asking about the pay I got for my job for months May through November**,   a period in which I blocked them on everything except phone calls   (which they never tried, I called them when our cat died in July and  when I needed their signature for a contract to move in with my friends   back in August), 'cause I wanted to grow independent from their  homophobic and controlling behinds; plus, they were throwing a hissy fit  over me wanting to move in with my friends, which would be cheaper, and  would also be better company than my ex-flatmates.  Anyway,   during those months I was wholly responsible for myself. I knew they received details for all three of our accounts (one for each) at their   place, which is why I explicitly told the bank to not forward them my  own details anymore. Now I find out they just went to the bank clerk, an  old friend of  theirs, and he just gave it out willy-nilly. Like bro,  this is  the European Union. Dafaq you doin'?🤣  Right now I want to take their money (not official, by the way: it was handed under the table through dad's work on contruction. Here in Italy it's pretty popular) so I can pay for this course, but if they annoy me too much, I'll just ignore their offer. The plan was for me to try and  get money under the table as a waiter anyway, so I could still get the  unemployment.  A friend said I  should be pissed that they looked into my bank account, a blatant  invasion of privacy, and I know it is, but I just want the  money so I  can find a job that I like better, and not have to work as an   under-paid waiter or do cleaning. I love going to Uni and study foreign  languages, but I also love practicing them, and having money to eat well  and travel somewhere, and not have to rely on my parents anymore.

He spends nearly all his free time on the couch, playing video games on our large TV. He's working on his issues and I do not begrudge him the one activity that helps. I got him headphones so the sound isn't a problem.The problem is that I sometimes have to sit in the living room too, to work on my laptop (it's that or the bedroom, and the bedroom is cramped and dark and not at all set up for working). The way our livingroom is set up, I can sit in a chair other than the couch, but the TV is always in my line of vision. It's not an issue with most games, but for some reason the motion of first-person games drives me out of my mind. There's this constant whirring around in my peripheral vision I find impossible to block out, and if I look directly at the TV I get immediately seasick. Right now I have a baseball cap pulled low and am bending my head enough that the screen is blocked... But my neck hurts. I've mentioned it to him before, but he forgets.  It's difficult to change the seating without it seeming super passive-aggressive, but I hate to ask him to play a different game. He deserves to engage in activities he enjoys in his own home! And I don't want him to think I'm berating him for feeling depressed.  I work outside the house, so there are lots of times he could play first-person games when I'm not here. And he has plenty of other games --this is just the latest (I got it for him for xmas, didn't think ahead lol).  WIBTA if I asked him? And how can I word it in the least AH-ey way possible?  EDIT: The reason changing the seating would feel passive-aggressive is that it would involve moving a very large, heavy chair to face the back wall -- it would not be a permanent change, it would be very obviously for no other reason than to avoid seeing the TV, and it would make a bunch of noise and be very noticeable.

We live a half hour away from my parents, and the proximity has proven really beneficial to us because my parents can, and have been willing to, help with taking care of Tom since he was born. This has been very helpful, especially through the pandemic, and we are very grateful for the time and energy they put in.  My dad is not the ideal caregiver to a child because he takes the doting grandparent stereotype to the extreme. He will almost never say no to Tom, so Tom gets to do whatever he wants whenever he wants to, if my dad is the only one watching him. My dad also has a habit of sometimes falling asleep while watching the kid. Because of these reasons, my mom, my wife, and I agree that my dad should not be left to watch Tom by himself for long periods of time.  This past weekend, I was sick, so my parents offered to take Tom for a day so my wife and I can get some rest. We happily accepted. Things were going well, until in the middle of the night, my dad calls me because Tom had woken up crying. Tom has been occasionally doing this recently as he's just transitioning to a full size bed from the crib, plus my parents' house is not his most familiar environment. I offered my dad some advice on how we normally handle the situation at home: keep the lights off (avoid stimuli), lay him back down, comfort him until he falls back asleep. My dad follows very little of my advice, and after a while, Tom is fully awake and talking about breakfast. This was around 2am. I told my dad Tom probably thinks it's morning, and he shouldn't need to eat at this hour. He disregards this and brings him downstairs to eat. I'm pretty annoyed at this point, but there wasn't much I could do. I tell him to just put Tom back to bed after he's done eating. At this point, my dad starts ignoring me, presumably because he doesn't agree with what I'm saying. For most of the next hour, I try texting, calling, Facetiming, and get no response. We have a baby camera set up where Tom sleeps at my parents' place, so I know he's not in bed. I'm normally a night owl anyway, so staying up this late isn't an issue, but knowing my son is not in bed when he should be, and not knowing what he's doing because I'm getting stonewalled by my dad, really enraged me. Eventually, at some point past 3am, I see on the baby cam that my mom has taken Tom upstairs again, and is starting to put him back to bed.  I've heard nothing from my dad since that night. The next day when my wife was picking Tom up, she learned from my mom that after Tom ate around 2am, my dad's plan was to let Tom watch TV while he slept on the couch. This seems to confirm that he was stonewalling me because he knew I did not agree with what he wanted to do.  Given my dad's actions, I'm considering whether I want him watching Tom at all going forward. WIBTA if I don't let my dad take care of Tom anymore?"

She has however always been very judgemental of the way my husband and I’s relationship works, mostly the fact that we’re always together. A couple of years ago I was going through a difficult time and on a couple of instances I had to cancel plans on going to parties where she would be along with some other family members and mutual friends and I know it bothered her.

This morning, after weeks of no contact, I messaged her telling her I was sorry for dropping out last minute but my husband’s mental health was my priority and I was hurt of her ghosting me and I hoped we could talk it out around a drink or something. She messaged me back something along the lines of :  « I was disappointed because you always do this and I feel like you’re always with him and everything else in your life comes second. It’s not really that you bailed on us that’s bothering me because we’re used to it but it’s more about the consequences like everybody bitching about it for 30 minutes straight.

He is loud and arrogant and treats everyone like shit. He has a sister [14F] that’s a grade below us and she’s the complete opposite. I haven’t met her personally, but you can tell she’s a nice girl.  My classmate doesn’t really care for her or look over her unless she’s around some other boy. He is very overprotective and tries to keep his friends as far from her as possible.  A few weeks ago my classmate’s parents came to pick him and his sister up. His sister took longer than usual to get to the gates so my classmate had to look for her. I happened to be walking past the field when my classmate found his sister and a male friend of hers talking by a tree. He yelled at her and she grabbed her things and left. As they made their way to the gates, he kept on calling her a whore and asking her what would’ve happened if he had not looked for her. He also talked about it in our groupchat making his sister seem as if she was trying to kiss him  The next day during civics we were discussing morals and ethics, specifically double standards. A classmate mentioned how being interested in someone is seen different for men and women. I then raised my hand and commented “yeah, [my classmate’s name] calls his sister a whore for talking to guys even though he’s one himself.” I was sent to the principals office where I explained why I said what I said. Now she’ll have a meeting with his parents to tell them about it. My friends say that it was a family issue and I shouldn’t have said it for everyone to hear but I don’t regret what I did. So, AITA?"

I have never really had a long term relationship longest was about 1 year but it was on and off.  I never planned to have kids or get married. I was happy being single. I hadn't dated at all in 3 years.   About 3 1/2 years ago I met a woman at work (36f) and became friends with her. She is a single divorced mom of 3 teens. We became close and 2 1/2 years ago started dating. In October 2022 I proposed (we plan on waiting a few years to get married, once her two oldest have graduated High School). We are happy and just enjoying life. We are on the same page when it comes to kids. I like hers just fine and get along with them but don't want any of my own and she doesn't want any more.   I have a friend 32f who I have been friends with since high school. We dated for like maybe a month back then but we just were not compatible and just remained good friends. She is the type who is always in some kind of new relationship every month. She always goes for the same type of guy, not in looks but in personality and they are not the type who want to settle down and get married and have kids, they are the type who want to go out party, drink and do drugs.  I love this friend but ever since I have got engaged she has been making snide comments about my fiancée being old, telling me I am settling for someone with baggage (kids) and that I should find someone else. Or ""teasing"" that ""I thought you never wanted marriage""   I usually just brush it off and move on but the other night we were at a mutual friends house (Fiancée was not there, she was at something for one of her kids) for a small get together.  My friend was there and was crying about her latest guy breaking up with her. I said ""I'm sorry"" and then just kind of ignored her, but then she turned on me and started yelling ""Don't sit there all smug and tell me you're sorry, when you settled for a old ugly fat woman, just so you could say you were engaged before me! You are just using her because she owns a house and a car and works a nice job""   I stood up from where I was sitting, looked at her and said ""You are a jealous bitch and quit going for the pieces of shit that you go for and find a REAL man that treats you right, and apologize to me about what you just said THEN I will speak to you again, until then FUCK OFF!"" I walked out.   Later that night my phone was blowing up with texts from her and other friends saying, I was an asshole  to talk to an old friend like that and that she was just speaking the truth, that a lot of them don't understand why I am with someone like my fiancée. They also think I need to apologize to my friend. I told them all to fuck off, that I am happy and that's all that matters.   So AITA for calling my friend a jealous bitch and leaving the party?"

We try and keep things as simple as possible - there's a deli right down the road I will place online orders from, then pickup and bring back in time for everyone to chow down in between meetings.  We don't have an HR team to do this for us (small company) and we don't have a company card I can charge these lunches to (again, small company) so I have been using my own credit card and expensing it to our CEO directly. I will attach a copy of the receipt and include with each expense report, however I have been adding a line item for gas IMO, even tho this place is right down the block, each trip adds up and it's not about the price of gas as much as it's about the effort I have put in for each person to make sure they get what they ordred + going offsite to pickup the food and everything else.  My CEO approached me and stated that while the cost of lunches is easily covered by the company, the gas cost is negligible and quite frankly, insulting that I am charging the company for gas. The sheer fact that I am getting free lunch by definition should cover the gas cost I'm paying (and then some!) He called me an AH for carging the company for my lunch as well as my car's gas fee.

Ashley lived about an hour away in a different county and would drive down to the church almost every Sunday. Anyways as we’re at the party Joe brought up some skate park thing he heard of that was built in a school that was around the area and Ashley said “oh yea that’s a 2 minute walk down the road wanna go there?” And ofc he agrees and we head down there. We go to this abandoned looking school that apparently Ashley went to at one point and she even told us that it had been abandoned for years now and Joe said it too so I went with them. While we’re there I’m looking at all the broken windows and graffiti and like every teenager does I climbed through one of the broken windows and I look inside for a bit and while I’m inside Joe picks up a rock and smashes the window. We were so far we couldn’t hear the alarms going off so we just kept exploring and they couldn’t fit through the window so they asked me to open the door to let them in. Anyways end of story the cops showed up and since Ashley was an adult she got arrested or charged with trespassing and has to go to court but she can’t afford it. I forgot to mention that me, Ashley, and Joe are apart of a bigger group but the group didn’t go with us but she told them the whole story and they all started yelling only at me and called me a selfish asshole for not wanting to pay her court fee after I told them many times I didn’t have the money which is true because my parents are currently trying to get a divorce but this friends group is so toxic and they’re all brown because of the Filipino in them but since I’m half white and half Filipino my skin is white and they’ve always almost hated me for it saying I wasn’t Filipino enough even though I act just like them but after I told them I didn’t have enough money because of financial problems they continued to call me a selfish asshole and they only called me that out of the 3 people that went so am I the a-hole for not having the money to pay for my friends court fees?

I figured that she would be busy with her own stuff that day, so I didn't bother inviting her.  When our mother called her from my party to wish her a happy birthday, she found out that the entire family except for her was throwing a party for me.

A couple times we even took a daytrip where my husband and her boyfriend all went together.  We had made plans for all of us to go somewhere. On the week of, her and I had texted each other a few times, and everything was good to go. She had wanted me to call that morning to make sure that they were up and getting ready. Well I called her, but no answer. A few minutes later, she texted me letting me know everything was good; we chatted a little about what were going to do that day. Long story short, I couldn't get ahold of her anytime after that. About 9 months later or so, I randomly received a text from her: a short how are you. I replied, but then a few days later, we actually spoke on the phone. She kinda apologized for that day, but wouldn't really go into detail, just saying that she had been in the hospital for awhile, broke up with her boyfriend and had moved back in with her parents. And then that was pretty much it again. Two years pass. A few months ago, my husband and I had gone out to lunch. A few minutes after we sat down, I was looking around and guess who I saw working behind the bar! My husband said that I should go say hi - I was reluctant at first, but I eventually did. Before I got to her though, she had spotted me. She had a huge smile on her face while she ran out from behind the bar, giving me a big hug. We chatted for a few minutes, but then she came over to the table where my husband and I were sitting, saying hi to him, and chatting to the both of us (coincidentally, her boyfriend that we had hung out with before, was also there as they had gotten back together). He came over a few minutes after she did. While we were all chatting, her and I exchanged phone numbers. She asked me to text her in a couple of days though because it would be her day off. I texted her around noon. She didn't text me back until the next morning, on her way to work. Again, it was short and superficial. I waited a few days, and texted her just to see how she was doing. I received a reply about a week later. I responded but with no reply from her. I let 2 weeks go by, and I decided to text her again (just a short how are you). And again, nothing. I sent her a couple more how are you texts in the next 2 months. My last text was asking her, at the very least, let me know that she's alive and ok. Although, given her past behavior, I wasn't too-too worried. About 2 weeks later is when I heard back from her. And the text didn't really say much, except for the fact that it was like 5 pages long, and it was her complaining about her job, the people she works with, and blah blah. Well I decided not to respond to her. I wasn't going to ""chase"" a supposed ""friend"". So, AITA for disappearing on her like she had done to me? BTW no, I haven't heard from her since."

I am transgender, female to male. I have a uterus still and so while I’m still on testosterone there is still a very very small chance of pregnancy.  It’s like jumping through hoops to get my tubes tied, and my partner wants to get a vasectomy pretty badly.  However, he’s waiting because his sister wants to use him as a sperm donor for his wife so their child will have her genetic.  At first I didn’t really care but the longer I thought about it the more uncomfortable I feel. And I’m probably just being an asshole and insane.  But the idea of my partners seed getting someone else pregnant and then seeing that child and knowing it’s biologically my boyfriends makes my skin feel like it’s on fire. Like some primitive rage I cannot explain.  I suffer from BPD So it’s entirely possible I’m being irrational and jealous.  My partner isn’t also super set on the idea and at first I said I didn’t care and it’s whatever he wants to do. But as the weeks have passed since then I feel sick about it all.  Not only that but it sucks he can’t get a vasectomy until his SIL decides she’s ready and honestly who knows when that’ll be… and I’d rather not risk my own accidental pregnancy if it’s possible to avoid. Especially when being put on a waiting list to get this done can take months or years anyways!  So… WIBTA for asking him not to be their sperm donor? If I’m being irrational I take full responsibility and will try to think on this longer. Thank you for taking the time to read this!"

This afternoon, he told me he had a job interview phone call that would have been right when we had plans, and I asked if he wouldn’t mind taking the call in the car on our way to the activity. (I’ve done it before when working with him). I had paid for our parking spot to get to the activity, which we had to get to by a certain time to ensure we could park in it. I was concerned about our time limit, and also asked if leaving without him was an option. He initially said yes, but then later sent me a nasty text accusing me of being selfish when he had waited all morning for him.

I bought it when I was 23 after letting my business partner take our shared assets in exchange for 600k. we owned a few properties together since we had bought our first place at 20 and 21 back when we were dating and even though we didn't work out we stayed in business together. I closed on my house a few months after my 23rd birthday. I had only been working part-time while I was managing our properties so aside from my bed and some little things from my apartment I stayed in my house for months while it was basically empty. I had always wanted to be a pastry chef and a local community college has a program that lets you get your certificate in almost anything for free with just 16 weeks of classes and if you choose to continue afterward your credits will roll over. That's where I met my fiance James (M27). James was a chef at a high-end restaurant. He had been working since 16 he started as a busser and worked his way up. While he had a lot of experience, he wanted to have a degree to back it up. We hit it off pretty quickly, he even taught me how to drive, helped me develop recipes, and helped me pick out the perfect spot to put my bakery. He proposed to me in Jamaica on August 8th, 2022. When we got back home I moved in with him. I've been perfecting recipes in my house as I had taken the time to make the kitchen to my liking. I tend to put my phone on DnD just to make sure I have no distractions. There have been a few times when I have missed calls from James and I see that it really bothers him but it's not like I go at random times I have a set schedule and I rarely go off of it.  About a week ago I finished baking quite early and ended up taking a nap my phone was still on DnD and I woke up to James banging on the door.  He told me he had been calling me for hours.  I told him I had forgotten to take my phone off DnD. He suggested that if he should have a key he could use for emergencies or in case something like this happened again. I said no because this is my safe space and I'm still adjusting to living with someone. The other day when I finished baking I noticed it was raining and I decided to call James because I don't feel comfortable driving in the rain. He didn't call me when he got here he knocked on the door and when I opened it he complained about getting wet while waiting for me and said he wouldn't have to wait if he had a key. I pointed out that he could've called me and I would've just come to the car. he said that wasn't the point and me not giving him a key was a slap in face. Yesterday I noticed he had one of those ""minute keys"" in his glove compartment while looking for my lipgloss I left in his car I immediately knew what he did and called my brother to help me change the locks, last night at dinner I let him know I found the key and told him it wouldn't be on any use as I had changed the locks.

When I did babysit them and we would agree she would pick them up by a certain time she would come hours later and by the time my energy was totally drained and I’d always shout at her to come on time. Anyways since I have a part time job myself and I’m just busy with work and school she asks me to babysit a lot more these days. We live 5 minutes walk from each other and at least before she’d bring them to me to my house and I’d babysit them here but lately she’s been asking me to babysit at her house which I don’t like since I had a falling out with her husband. She expected me to babysit them for 8+ hours and then walk over to her house and drop them off. I usually accept since I can’t be bothered to be shouted at by my mother however this past weekend I snapped at her. She’s a stay at home mom and basically takes care of them 5 days a week. And sometimes even on the weekends which I don’t understand since it’s her husbands job to look after them on the weekend so she can have the weekend to herself. She called me on a Sunday morning asking me to babysit and I told her what her husband was doing then she asked me if I was in love with him since I’m always asking her why he doesn’t look after his own kids. I swore at her and called her a pathetic b word and stupid for letting a man like that walk all over her and I told her she has no life no personality since she has gotten married to him and that she’s basically a single mom since she literally has to continuously ask him to do common sense things for her and her kids ( being a single mom is very taboo in my culture ) now my mom is mad at me for disrespecting my elder sister and she won’t be coming over anymore. I kinda feel like I overreacted due to stress and constantly having to help out when I barely have any free time .

With the first project, I was able to contribute significantly to the team by making suggestions and assisting in various ways. It was created using the DevC++ IDE, a lightweight IDE that my (old and weak) PC could handle.  However, as Jennifer (the group's ""Product Owner"") stated, my contribution level began to decline sharply in the second semester, when we began working with NetBeans &amp; Java, two rather ""pre-historical"" IDE and languages that my PC couldn't handle correctly; it would freeze and get hot within minutes of opening both the IDE and a browser.  We continued to work with Java, but as COVID constraints eased, we returned to Uni, which was excellent because I would be allowed to use the powerful PCs provided by our university.  As our classes progressed, I became increasingly frustrated with Java because, since I couldn't execute many of the programs presented in class earlier, I would take twice as long as my friends to complete a task.  We finished the semester with an ""A"" for an unfinished but excellent endeavor. The girls felt like I and Louis could've done a lot more, but because my computer couldn't handle Java, I couldn't do much. Nonetheless, I attended all meetings and was always proactive, offering comments and ideas.  We used Web throughout the second half of 2022. (HTML, CSS, JS, and Angular). Because my computer could run VS Code, I was assigned to work on: a page of our website (it was 90% completed by the project's deadline, but there were some issues with Git (I dual-booted my PC with Ubuntu, as it is a lot lighter than Windows, and I was not used to the terminal and the system environment, so I zipped my work and sent it via e-mail to Noelle) and fonts.) and Noelle assisted me in finalizing it, a use-case diagram for our system, and a test-case sheet for the system (due to using LibreOffice instead of Word, some formatting/text was lost when converting files from. ods to .SLS). Martin assisted me in completing it.  The year is now 2023. Jennifer messaged me about a week ago, saying she and Noelle thought it would be better to remove me from the group for the next (and final) semester, due to my poor output over the last 1 1/2 years, and, to honor my friendship with them. I agreed to their decision but told her that it wasn't fair, at least for me, to do so.  It's not their fault that my computer is outdated.  It would have been very easy for me to say ""fuck it"" and not engage in meetings, offer ideas and comments, and so on because I couldn't assist much. Jennifer saw that I was pretty engaged at the beginning of the semester, always with fresh project ideas, but as the months passed and work became more ""code-heavy,"" I wasn't able to accomplish much.

Although there was no romantic spark, we agreed to remain friends, and we were a support to one another. For a while, we were calling once a week and it was nice to have contact with someone. I was living alone at the time and hundreds of miles away from family. She had considered me her best friend, and I acknowledged she was a good friend at the time.   However, over time, the phone calls became increasingly intrusive and trivial. She would call multiple times a day sometimes, just to tell me about gossip at work or that she was in a new relationship or that she'd bought this new food or whatever. A lot of the time, I would be called during work. I would end up counselling her over her various relationship breakups but I was having my own issues at work which I felt at times was trivialised. This became quite frustrating and suffocating.   I moved back home 18 months ago, and she has made a few comments that suggest that she doesn't like me being back home. In addition, the phone calls ramped up in intensity during this time. Around this time last year, I called a circuit breaker and said I needed some breathing space. Generally, she did respect this space but things haven't felt the same. We're in different phases of our lives and it has become increasingly apparent that we have less and less in common.   We met up last summer after a 9 month gap and I left feeling horrible afterwards.  Essentially, I visited her, we had some lunch, then I basically followed her around for a few hours while she did shopping that could have been done at any time - then I went on the long 4 hour train journey back. Her parents, who were also out in town, had spotted us and had criticised her for doing her shopping at this time, when I was only going to be around for a few hours. I silently thought to myself that a lot of the time, she wants someone to just be around but not to interact with.   Since this and after plenty of thinking, I've been speaking less and less to her, mostly because it had sapped my energy for months. I've felt better having my own space but I feel guilty that it has come to this point. But I was utterly exhausted talking to her after a point and I couldn't do it anymore. I see her name pop up on Facebook Messenger and I just get anxious and feel dread.  Should I explain things to her? Would there be any good in doing so?"

We've always been very close, she is like a family to me. As teens we promised each other to be our maids of honor.  As for the advice: She started dating this guy year and a half ago, I haven't met him yet(I moved away for work), just heard of him. She told he was older, which I don't have an issue with, or so I thought. He is 53 (no she is not a gold digger, he isn't by any means rich). I was happy for her, she really looks happy. But a week ago she announced to me that they got engaged and I suddenly started thinking more about it. He is 53, having heart issues, no actual money and no previous family (no kids etc.). I just don't think he deserves her. For gods sake she is 20, still studying and he is already getting close to retirement. In 20 years she will sit at home and take care of an old grumpy man. And if they have kids... They would get another grandpa instead of a father (her parents are younger than her bf). I don't know what to do, she wants me to be her maid of honor of course, but I don't really feel comfortable doing it. The more I hear of this guy, the more I dislike him. He works with children (summer camps etc.) which a lot of people see as a red flag since she is a lot younger than him. Anytime we talk about our relationships and she mentions anything about him kissing, touching her or more I see this creepy dude all-over the person I care about so much and it makes me want to hurt him. ... But on the other hand she seems happy. Her family wants me to talk her out of it.  And yes I've already talked to her about it, just a little more nicely and without mentioning the maid of honor issue.   So am I the asshole for considering breaking the promise of being her maid of honor (I'd still be going to the wedding)?"

Apparently it was quite expensive but I also believe he bought it in the January sales of the previous Christmas.  I already had a dressing gown which was old but I was quite fond of it and not ready to part with it so my mum has had it at her house keeping it in a cupboard for me. I like that dressing gown a lot. It is towel type material but not too heavy to wear, and is a peachy pink colour.  I obviously accepted my gift graciously and my boyfriend doesn't know I still have my other one, but I don't wear the new one a lot because 1, it's really heavy. It's towelling material on the inside with a cotton outer layer. 2, its white. On occasions where I have worn it, I've got the sleeves dirty because white shows all the dirt. It also seems to have yellowed on the neckline (bleugh, makes me feel like I'm dirty but I shower daily!).   I've been very cold lately and there's a cost of living crisis so I'm trying to keep the heating off as much as possible. I was wearing hoodies in leui of a dressing gown, but I just feel like I want a front opening and long dressing down as I often find my arms are cold and it's annoying to have to put on a pullover.  So WIBTH if I bought a new dressing gown to replace the one he bought me? I feel like enough time has passed, but I really don't want to hurt his feelings. If I bring back my old dressing gown I think he will know that I don't like the one he bought me."

I asked before I got my results if I could get a small amount of money if I get good grades. I asked for £20. My mum said no and started talking about how if I want money from her I should get off my ass and stop hiding in my room and I told her I'm more than happy to do chores when asked to. It really upset me when she said this because makes it out like I'm such a bad person but I'm willing to do chores if I'm asked to. I'm sitting in my room crying because she wasn't even proud of me and didn't show up to my results day.   I'm worried I'm TA because I asked for money but I never get pocket money and I rarely ask for money and usually buy plants with it anyway
