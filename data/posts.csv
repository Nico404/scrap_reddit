Using a throwaway here.   This afternoon I came to visit my aunt and uncle for the first time in a few years. They have a corgi/lab mix who is about 7 years old. The last time I was here she was a puppy so that’s how long it’s been since I visited.   When I came in the house I saw how overweight she is. This dog is at least 40lbs overweight. She struggles to stand up, can’t go up and down their small steps to get outside and has to be given a ramp when she wants to go out.   I know they love her dearly, but part of loving an animal is keeping them at a healthy weight. This girl is clearly uncomfortable.   So I watched them feed her a peanut butter cookie, pepperoni, a beef jerky, leftovers from dinner, and then a plate of chicken mixed with her dog food.   When we were sitting in the family room, I said “don’t you guys think she could lose some weight?” And my aunt laughed and said “oh no, she’s just fat and happy.” I tried to point out how uncomfortable she is and my aunt got snippy and said “you don’t even have a dog.” This pissed me off a little so I go “it makes you a terrible dog owner not to take your pet’s health seriously. You’re killing her with food.” And they got mad and said I needed to mind my business. Maybe they are right, I guess, but the dog can’t speak for herself.   AITA?"

So I work at a place with a locker room, which is a sort of separate room from the break room, the only thing separating it is a door though. We work in a large department (30ish people working each day) where everyone takes their lunch at the same time, 1:00-1:45. I typically finish my food 10 minutes early to ensure I have enough time to take care of me, use the bathroom, reapply deodorant, wash my face, refill my water, and put my food away if there’s any left.    So its 1:35, and I go to the locker room to do the things listed above. It’s my routine. But the door is locked. I go to my managers and ask if there’s a reason for this, and they said that there’s no reason why the door is locked. So I return to the locker room and knock on the door. No answer. I knock again, a bit louder but not too much to disturb my other coworkers trying to finish their break. Still no answer. I’m annoyed, thinking someone accidentally locked it on their way out, but I go to my manager to ask them to unlock it because I still have time to do my routine and don’t want to take up work time to do it. The manager needs to finish something up, so it’ll be a few. Great. I go to sit down in the break room, and a few minutes later the manager comes out with their keys and unlocks the door.    Apparently Bill(30(?)M) was in the locked locker room on the phone the whole time for a teledoc appointment. I didn’t hear him because the breakroom was pretty loud. He was pissed at me for interrupting his appointment with my knocking and for getting the manager because “he was almost finished if I would’ve just given him a minute”. My manager just dipped after this comment, which I don’t blame them for. I said that he didn’t have a right to deny access to the entire team because he doesn’t know how to schedule his doctor appointments outside of work. I was pissed, because I could just come in, grabbed my bag, and given him his space while finishing my routine in the bathroom, but he didn’t even let me know there was anyone in there.    Anyways, I vented to my other coworker Lisa about this and she said that I was in the wrong for not being more respectful of his use of his break, and that full time workers don’t have as much availability to schedule doctors appointments as part timers like me do. She also said he probably thought he would have the full 45 to take his call, instead of being interrupted early, which I didn’t think about tbh.   I’m not sure if I was in the wrong though, AITA?"

This is not the end all be all argument that some of these are but I felt like asking if I'm the AH here.  My husband's (31m) mother(50s) is a ""couponer"". I put that in quotations because I feel she just has a shopping addiction and uses couponing as an excuse to buy crap she doesn't need or use. Naturally, when she fills up her storage room, she trys to pass most of it onto her kids. This can be great for somethings like toilet paper, zip lock bags and some other nessesities but she goes way overboard. She will send over soaps, Toiletries, laundry detergent, ect that we can't or don't use. Just last week she sent a box of body wash, toothpaste, laundry detergent and dish soap that I can't use due to sensitive skin or allergies.  Now, I know I should be grateful because it should be saving us money that we can use in other areas but I'm sick of having to get rid of most of us. For years now, I've been asking my husband to talk to her about it. She doesn't have to stop because I know it makes her feel useful to ""help"" but I have asked him to discuss brands/ingredients. Each time, he says he will talk to her but he doesn't. I finally snapped last week. I was trying to sort through everything, the baby was crying, our oldest was talking non stop, I was trying to cook and I just lost it.  He came to see what was wrong when I snapped, telling him not to bring another thing into the house from his mom if he won't talk to her about it. He got mad and said I was being ungrateful. His mom was saving us money so I should be happy. I told him she wasn't saving us anything and I was sick of dealing with it. We spent 2 days not speaking and he still holds that I'm ungrateful.

And that when he was younger, they would call people with disabilities the r-word (he said the full word I just edited it).   I told him not to use that word as it's disrespectful to my community as it was a slur used against neurodiverse allistic people and autistic people. He said he didn't use it in a derogatory way in the conversation and I replied that the word itself is still rude and he wouldn't go around using other slurs like the f-slur or racial slurs in a sentence, so he shouldn't use this one.

This issue is about my daughter, Allie (26F).  She is very upset with me because I am going to allow my niece, Victoria (29F) to hold her wedding at my beach home (rental property). This is a rather large home and it has a pool and private beach access, which is the main selling feature of the home as a venue. I do vacation rentals and event rentals in the home.   I want to add that I am not a wealthy person and this property is used as a source of income so I will explain how I purchased it because it is relevant.  My father was not a good man. He was especially terrible to my sister, Carol (57F), and my mom (deceased). He was okay with my brother (55M) and me for some reason. Well, it would turn out that my father had money, we are not sure where it all came from but when he died, he left it all to me.  He explicitly left my sister who has had ongoing addiction issues and my brother because he is gay (Another story). I decided to purchase the home and set up a business. My sister and brother are not involved but they have free access to the home when it is not in use and I use some of the profits to help my sister and will send my brother a check yearly.  So to the issue, Allie was supposed to get married in May but her fiancé called off the wedding in November and she is devastated (I really do feel for her).  She was going to use the home and we were even doing some renovations to get it ready. Victoria got engaged in December and last week Victoria called and asked if she would be able to use the home in September and I said of course. When I talked to my daughter last night I mentioned this and she flipped out.    I was really shocked at her reaction but she said I am rubbing salt in the wound by allowing her cousin to steal her wedding venue. She went on and on about how she should be the first wedding there (she isn’t, there is one the week before her now-canceled wedding).  She said she will not attend because she will be suffering the whole time knowing it should have been her.   My niece has had a tough life due to her mother’s issues and I know providing her with a venue would allow her to have a wedding she would not otherwise be able to afford, which I tried to explain to Allie.  She said I am picking my niece over her and I pointed out that I would have let my niece use it even if Allie got married there. She said it wouldn’t have been a problem if her wedding wasn’t canceled. But I should have compassion for her the way I do for my niece.  The way I see it is that my siblings and I should have equally inherited from our father. I chose not to alter the estate because I didn’t trust my sister with all that money but her daughter should benefit from the money the same way my daughter can. I try to be as generous as possible with her and her brother but maybe I am going too far."

My mum bought me a 'replacement' for one of my fav pet birdies but he's way too hormonal to work with. I bought him a friend for his own mental sake, even if I hate him to bits. They are now in the care of my mum, not me.  Long story short, stupid uneducated 13 yr old me bought a pair of finches and put them in a cage with hookbills. The hookbills almost killed the finches so they got seperated. The finches bred in this other cage, resulting in the two + three chicks.  The're too loud for my mum so she said I have to keep them outside in a cage. The cage is WAY better, and my finch knowledge is thru the roof now. Genetics, care, diet, everything. So I decide to get another pair, totalling to seven birds. Then my old pair bred again and had three more chicks. Two died from being runts. So back down to eight. Then I buy two more finches for the sake of having more variety. I also bought two finches of a different species as they are known to foster chicks/care for sick birds.  But the summer heat gave them all mites. I bought the treatment and luckily they all survived. Then winter rolls around and they all get dangerously cold, one even almost dying. Bringing them inside in not an option. So, AITA for buying 12 birds, being under preapred?  Should add: I'm still dumb, but a year older (14). I know so much now and know my mistakes.

After watching the game I realized that while I thought the story was great, the gameplay itself was nothing special.

People in this story: Me F22 my friend we’ll call Sally F 25 &amp; her boyfriend Gary M 25  Some backstory: I met Gary middle school. Gary has always been a troubled person, very angry. Got worse growing up. Been on probation since 18, any charge you can think of. I met Sally before the pandemic &amp; we became close. Gary &amp; Sally get in a relationship. Being Sally’s friend I watched Gary be blatantly the worst partner in every aspect.   What happened: Alcohol was a big factor in a lot of things between Gary &amp; Sally. This night included. Our group went to the bar &amp; it was a shitshow to say the least. Leaving the bar drinks at a mutual friends was the plan. Sally was talking about things she didn’t know were true &amp; weren’t her business &amp; Gary got upset with her. This was a common habit of hers. Gary got mad. Sally getting upset as Gary got more angry she ask that she &amp; I leave &amp; go to my house knowing my house is a safe place for my friends.  Before we left the Sally took Gary’s truck keys knowing it would make him mad. At my house Sally begs me to call 911 if Gary shows, I assure I will. He does very angry, &amp; Sally will not give him his keys &amp; he calls 911 on Sally FIRST. My mom comes to the door &amp; asks him to leave, he won’t &amp; Gary headbutts my glass door shatters it &amp; runs away. Sally screams to call 911 &amp; I do. I got the incident on video &amp; sent it to a few close friends. The end.    Moving forward: Sally is now upset with me for calling 911 because Gary is on probation &amp; they have a baby &amp; she doesn’t want him to get in more trouble &amp; go to jail. She’s telling me I don’t understand &amp; that we should of “thought about it” before calling the police. I reminded her that Gary called first before he even did what he did to my door &amp; that 911 would have been coming regardless &amp; it’s not my fault he’s an idiot for 1. Calling the cops when he’s drunk &amp; on probation or 2. Him putting his head through my door because i definitely didn’t ask for it. Sally removes me on everything &amp; begins to tell people that I’m making her situation about me &amp; that I’m not a good friend &amp; she’s mad I sent people the video. Now, should I have sent it around? Maybe not but I dont believe I’m wrong because no one was hurt &amp; MY property was what was damaged. But I just have a hard time seeing how I’m a bad friend for tying to keep her safe from a situation we both know is bad. &amp; I wasn’t trying to make her situation my own by showing people a video of Gary being the person he always has been.   SO… AITA for trying to be a good friend?"

He was the one to move in to my place. Everything went fine, we both took care of housework, chores and our 3 now shared pets - my dog and his two cats.  We met through a video game and both consider ourselves to be gamers of sorts. He brought his own PC with him but resorted to selling it shortly after the move as he needed some money for a surprise bill that came in - we're both unable to work for the time being, due to mental health issues and such. I adviced against selling the PC, telling him it would be something that he'd regret because we can't afford to get a new one for a replacement with high-end GPUs and other expensive components that his old PC had. He was adamant in his decision and at the end of the day there was nothing I could do: his stuff is his stuff and he can do with it as he wishes.  It took him a couple of weeks to then start gaming on my PC, which was okay to me as I now obviously considered the PC a shared one. However he would start spending less time with me and hanging out more on Discord with his online friends. Again, this was fine by me since the new WoW expansion had just come out. I was happy to see him have fun, even if it meant that I couldn't play my games as often.  However, me giving him the green light to use the PC led to him ignoring me for almost all day and spending 95% of his time online. The only time that I get to talk to him is in the morning before he turns on the PC. He ignores housework and chores even when I ask him to do something, anything, around the house. A good example of this is that I asked him to fill the dishwasher a week ago: lo' and behold, the dishes are still scattered all over the kitchen counters.  It's pretty much been all on me to take care of cooking, laundry, dishes, the pets and everything else for over a month now and honestly at this point I'm starting to feel more and more like a 1950's burnt out housewife than a modern day fiancée. He even asks me to bring him his meds as he's gaming because there's always something going on and he can't leave the keyboard.  I really want to tell him to direct more of his time and attention on real life and me, his fiancée, rather than on friends and gaming. However I'm not sure if that's a jerkish thing to ask for since he doesn't have that many friends to spend time with in the first place, and he seems really happy playing his game - which has to be paid for by month to play, or something.  He's neurodivergent like myself and I can understand getting hyperfocused but I'm also tired of keeping up the household on my own and feeling like a butler of sorts.  Would I be the asshole?"

I want to add that I am not a wealthy person and this property is used as a source of income so I will explain how I purchased it because it is relevant.  My father was not a good man. He was especially terrible to my sister, Carol (57F), and my mom (deceased). He was okay with my brother (55M) and me for some reason. Well, it would turn out that my father had money, we are not sure where it all came from but when he died, he left it all to me.  He explicitly left my sister who has had ongoing addiction issues and my brother because he is gay (Another story). I decided to purchase the home and set up a business. My sister and brother are not involved but they have free access to the home when it is not in use and I use some of the profits to help my sister and will send my brother a check yearly.  So to the issue, Allie was supposed to get married in May but her fiancé called off the wedding in November and she is devastated (I really do feel for her).  She was going to use the home and we were even doing some renovations to get it ready. Victoria got engaged in December and last week Victoria called and asked if she would be able to use the home in September and I said of course. When I talked to my daughter last night I mentioned this and she flipped out.    I was really shocked at her reaction but she said I am rubbing salt in the wound by allowing her cousin to steal her wedding venue. She went on and on about how she should be the first wedding there (she isn’t, there is one the week before her now-canceled wedding).  She said she will not attend because she will be suffering the whole time knowing it should have been her.   My niece has had a tough life due to her mother’s issues and I know providing her with a venue would allow her to have a wedding she would not otherwise be able to afford, which I tried to explain to Allie.  She said I am picking my niece over her and I pointed out that I would have let my niece use it even if Allie got married there. She said it wouldn’t have been a problem if her wedding wasn’t canceled. But I should have compassion for her the way I do for my niece.  The way I see it is that my siblings and I should have equally inherited from our father. I chose not to alter the estate because I didn’t trust my sister with all that money but her daughter should benefit from the money the same way my daughter can. I try to be as generous as possible with her and her brother but maybe I am going too far."

When we had arrived (25 minute drive) I had asked if she wanted to come in. She said no she will continue to talk to her sister on the phone. So I figured I’d be okay to talk with him and his s/o for a couple minutes. 12 minutes to be exact (I had asked him for the ring times) I get outside and I can feel the tension in the car. I ask her what’s wrong and she was super upset that I wasn’t literally in and out. I tried explaining that she was talking with her sister I figured I’d be okay for a couple minutes.

We had a minor break where she broke up with me last year in July because apparently I had too many problems. About a month later she apologized and asked to reconcile for our son and for the house we had applied for, to which I accepted under the premise that we could have healthy communication because we did couples counseling, she was shutting me down and invalidating/disrespecting me regularly. Basically after the love bombing phase she started doing it again and finally I had it about 2 weeks ago, broke things off calmly and now we arrive at my dilemma. She says if I take my name off of the home loan she’ll have to refinance with the current high interest rates, but I need my own place as I’m very uncomfortable being around her atp. I have a place to stay but I don’t want to be a burden. Would I be the asshole for taking my name off of the loan?"

In a year when I come visit again for the holidays??   My parents separated about 4 years ago after he found out my Mom was cheating. They tried to make things work at first but shortly after Mom left and cut contact for a few years. I met with her in person for the first time last month. They're divorced now but they're still going to court because Mom wants her half but Dad claims she abandoned us and doesn't deserve anything.   After they separated he started dating a lady (a different one), he moved in with her right away and even took her kids out. About a year later he breaks up with her because she was ""too clingy"". Immediately started dating his current girlfriend and moves in with her. She too has kids and they call him ""stepdad"" now. Again they've ONLY BEEN DATING 1.5 YEARS.  Now suddenly he wants to get married again and doesn't even want to get a prenup because ""they have a verbal agreement"" and she's ""a good woman because she brings him lunch to work"".  I haven't talk to him yet. I, of course, want my parents to be happy and I'm glad they got divorced they both seem much happier now. But I can't help feel this a HUGE mistake and he's moving too fast, but it seems he's made up his mind and I can't change it now."

And one normal day when I got home from school me and my mom got into a fight. I don’t remember how it started.  The fight started escalating and as a young teenager it ended by me shouting “I hate u!” To my mom and slamming my bedroom door shut. The next week my mom left the house and didn’t even tell me. When I asked her where she was she said she left. When I asked where she lived now she didn’t want to answer.  My dad continued to abuse me. I was getting sick of it and asked my mom if I could stay with her. And she ended up replying saying that it’s my own fault she didn’t bring me and that I deserved getting abused. I was pretty shocked when she said that.   I kept asking her if I could please stay with her and she continued to say it was my own fault and I deserved it. In the end I managed to convince her for me to live with her. But I still think about it to this day and thing I am in the wrong.  AITAH?

I said I would be too tired and overwhelmed and I would not be in the right condition to entertain guests. He said he wouldn’t stop his family from coming right away if they wanted to and that they’re coming to see the baby and not me.

I'm not going to lie and say I'm perfect either, I get into hobbies, spend a lot of my credit, pay it off, rinse and repeat.   My mother wants to buy a new home which she says is to be for me whenever she passes away. She just paid off a home that was supposed to be a 30 Year loan, and got it within 15, she got $80K by selling it off. (Mind you we haven't lived in that house for about 90% of my life due to us moving out of state, that home was in a completely different state far away from us.) So shes got the $80K and wants to get a new house with it; the new house is worth $290K, and her credit is bad.   She asked if I could get the loan under my name since I have better credit than her and that she would promise to get this paid. AS MUCH as i want to trust my mom here and know that she's capable of keeping a promise; she's 58, if anything happens, like her getting hurt on the job. then i can't pay that myself. I'm not making enough to pay for everything if anything happens. Her plan to combat against this is to have people rent out the home we're purchasing by renting certain parts of the home to rent. I asked her who would be living in these 3 rooms. She could only give me 1 name and exclaimed that ""anyone would want to live here for $900 rent"", then i said ""True, but no one wants to live in a garage?"" She goes ballistic and tells me that i don't have the vision. I told her I'm being realistic and added on by saying ""Look, you're 58, you can't pay off the house in 10 years, you'll be 68 and likely retired, I'll be stuck with a giant house that'll be foreclosed"" She is once again angered when I'm telling her about the real circumstances that can happen. I asked, ""Ok, so how many people right now, are willing to rent"" She says that she has 3 people for 3 rooms. I pushed her on it and asked ""Can I get the names for said 3 people?"" She could only give me 1 and provided only the race of the other 2 renters with no name. I pushed again and asked ""Ok, not the race, the names of these 2 people?"" She responds with a ""Huh, what did you say?"" And that told me everything. (Not to poison the well here, but after repeating it 3 times and her not being able to provide me a quick enough answer to a name for these individuals aside from the first name was super sus to me.) She then got mad at me and told me that it ""doesn't matter, anyone would want to rent here"" I asked her if she lied to me and she wasn't able to admit it. I pushed her again, and then she admitted to lying to me about there being 2 other people who were interested.  I'm trying to plan out my budget so that I can find a place to rent, lowest i could find is $700-1000 a month and try to pay off my debt while I do it, but i feel like it makes the most sense in the long run; also I already tried seeing if i could live with friends to no avail."

I went to a concert in DC with a buddy at a rather inconvenient location, transportation-wise. We got off at the metro station and had to hop on a school bus specifically for the event. After a few hours of music and fun, it was time to leave. As we walked out, ushers were telling everyone to ""go down the hill and wait for the bus"".  We went down the hill in a large crowd and sat around for about two hours. The bus never came, and slowly people were trickling away, I supposed catching other rides or something ,and we didn't want to leave and miss the bus, having assumed it had already taken a load of people and maybe got caught getting back in traffic.  It was nearly 1AM and I was starting a new job the next day, and I needed to get home, so we decided to finally trickle away down the street until we find a gas station with a LONG ASS LINE for the bus. Apparently we needed to go down the hill, then take a right and go down the street.   So there we were, middle of somewhere in DC, with me as the last person in a giant line for the bus to get to the subway. The subway stop running at midnight and I'm not sure what to do. I hear a noise and turn around, and the bus driver stops the bus right in front of me. Everyone turns and rushes forward as the driver opens the door and yells ""Everyone STOP!"" and points a finger at me, ""I saw HIM first in line, so he's on first.""  I don't know how the driver wasn't aware I was the back of the line considering we were mostly facing that direction, and I assumed there was only one bus driver.  Dilemma:  The *right* thing would have been to tell the driver that the line started at the other end. But I wanted to get home, and I didn't want to get absolutely destroy by tired, angry concert goers if I'd corrected the driver and royally pissed them off.

My grandma babysat me a good amount during my childhood, but I remember \_not\_ being the golden grandchild among my cousins, and my mom was also treated as less than her siblings. Still, my mom tried a lot to occasionally visit my grandma, take her out to lunch, etc. and really valued things like family get togethers.

A moment that I clearly remember is a few days after my mom passed, I met with my grandma for lunch. It felt like she was trying to coerce me to convince my dad into paying for everything. I started crying from being overwhelmed, and she asked me, ""It's been three days, why are you still crying?"" That really stuck with me, though I don't think she knows how badly that affected me.  Pre-pandemic, I still occasionally met up with her to visit my mom's grave out of what felt like obligation. It's hard to describe how I feel towards her, but conversations generally feel uncomfortable because I don't speak great Chinese, she nags or criticizes me a lot, and is nosy. I don't feel like myself when I'm talking to her, I play up a different persona often to appease her. I get intense anxiety seeing her name pop up when she's trying to call me and really dread talking to her. She's given me shit for how I do things, and for not calling/visiting her. I get that maybe her style of communicating is just ""tough love"", but regardless, I'd rather just not talk to her and I want to live my life without her checking up on me and pressuring me to spend time with her. Our communication slowed a lot during COVID though, and I actually haven't spoken to her in a year since I never initiate reaching out.  Bringing us to today - it's lunar new year. There's a family gathering on my mom's side that's happening tomorrow. I'm not going, because I don't care for my mom's relatives and the politics game they play. Grandma's tried to call me twice. I have so many ill feelings towards my family and the thought of interacting with them stresses me out. But I wonder if I'm being selfish for not ""trying"" with them.  I let one of my relatives know to communicate to her that I won't be there. Tbh I would much rather just be NC with all of them, like my dad. I'm not interested in repairing whatever this is either. But I get the feeling she does care for me, so I'm trapped between feeling guilty for being LC/NC but also stressing about the idea of talking to her. WIBTA if I kept this up?"

A few weeks ago she asked me to drive the kid to and from school one day. I agreed to even though I ended up being late for work and had to use my lunch break to pick the kid up. It was okay with me because it was a one time thing.  HOWEVER, since that one favor she has asked me no less than a dozen times for drives and continues to even though I've tried to make it pretty clear that I can't be doing that all the time and have said no 10/12 times.  I'm not just being a jerk, I am a very busy person. My workplace is understaffed leaving me to work every day and double shifts several days a week, we have a hobby farm with lots of animals that need tending to, many pets inside the house, firewood that needs to be split and stacked daily, my husband works 14 hour days 7 days a week and is rarely home, etc. I'm spread pretty thin already and barely ever have more than 30 minutes to unwind before bed.  Today she called me a bunch of times and then texted me telling me she needed a drive at 6:30am. I live 30 minutes outside of town, as does she, but in opposite directions. So that's at least 2 hours of driving. I already have to get up at 6am to have enough time to do my morning chores, exercise and have enough time to make it to work for 8am. So essentially she is asking me to get up at 4am on a day I have a day shift and an evening shift.  I told her my work schedule and she asked me yet again. This time she was begging me, telling me she would buy me coffee and breakfast and pay for gas. She told me she is staying at her daughter's house tonight and needs to be at her own house in the morning.  I am pretty irritated at this point. I'm pretty sure she planned to stay at her daughter's house (even though she has no vehicle and no way to get home when she needs to) because she just assumed I would drive her in the morning. She has literally no backup plan.  I finally stopped trying to drop hints and flat out told her there is no possible way I can drive her. She again started begging. I said there is no way. And now she's mad at me."

Also I lurk here from my main and our younger cousins know my main so, throwaway.  I(32M) and my fiancée(31F) are getting married after 11 years of relationship. We had an agreement of not having a marriage if we aren't having kids because we are common-law but we decided we want kids and marriage will make the processes easier. We didn't have any proposals or anything, one day we sat our families down and said we would get married. Their joy was borderline scary. Both of our families are from Mediterranean Descent(we are 4th generation immigrants but all of us have strong bonds within our ancestry) so a giant wedding was in order but we tried to limit some things  Since last month, We started wedding arrangements and it is a disaster. We want to invite 300 people(a normal number for our cultures, our families are huge and we still see most of them regularly);we want a small music group, they want at least 4 different groups; we asked for a basic ceremony that would honor our background, they want a giant ceremony with 4 different parts. I wanted a black plain suit, they are trying to have a custom fitted tuxedo. My fiancée wants a simple white dress, they ask for the most extravagant wedding dress in the city(it is like 12K US Dollars). They also try to arrange a bachelor+bachelorette party, eant us to go on a honeymoon etc. The problem is,both of us are extreme introverts. We entertained the idea of wedding because we would never do this again but we can't handle it and both of us had break downs at our house.  Last week, the venue appointments have started and we just chickened out. Never told anyone anything, just left the city at night, found a cheap AirBnB and moved there for 2 months. We have jobs are full WFH so it isn't a problem. They still don't know where we are, they were angry at first and they are just now scared and all of our friends at work said we are the hugest assholes but we couldn't say anything. Both of us dropped classes in college if it had a presentation and standing up to our families is much more nerve wracking than that. So,Are we The Assholes?"

I am also a woman, and I work with all guys and one other girl tech. Everyday I do my job I’m supposed to. If tickets come in I take care of them, give them to support techs and sit on my phone, listen to a podcast/music, or listen to a YouTube video, until something I am able to do comes in. No one ever comes up to talk to me or says anything to me. I always come up and talk to people but no one comes up to my desk. I want to learn how to take and do tickets, as that is part of what this internship is, to eventually take tickets. I WANT to learn. I am OPEN and ALWAYS WILLING to learn. I ask for help. I think I’m a good worker. No one has yet to teach me or show me how things work for different companies we work for, or processes. They always say ‘there’s a KB (knowledge base) article for that’… most of the time they aren’t helpful and I like watching other people go through the processes of solving problems before I do it myself. We use Teams and I like using GIFs. It helps me express what I’m trying to convey as well. Well today, halfway through my shift, they block youtube, tenor, and giphy on my computer. I don’t mind it, I guess people notice I use these, okay whatever. But as I said I want to learn I want to be more of use.   There is another intern who works here but he’s a ‘legacy’ (his dad worked for the company previously) coworker. They teach him more than me and treat him more respectfully than me. I get nothing. When I try to talk to the other techs I get borderline bullied and treated like I’m dumb. I know they’re joking but sometimes these jokes go way too far. I know the obvious thing is to go talk to my boss, but I’m just not mentally ready to tattle on my coworkers. Plus with no communication from anyone about me listening to YouTube in the background or using GIFs apparently is ‘wrong’ can someone talk to me about it? Like I just want a bit of communication. I don’t want to be here. I don’t feel welcome most of the time.   AITA For thinking I’m Disliked?"

I politely declined (which sucked bc I love shortbread) and waited for them to step aside so I could get to my door without getting too close to them.   They didn’t move and the mom pressed me about buying some. Ok, whatever. It’s her job. I get it. I declined again and then she went “If you can afford to take care of a dog then you can afford some $5 cookies.” That struck a nerve and I blew up at her saying she was setting a terrible example for her daughter and $5 to her isn’t the same $5 to me. That she should be able to handle rejection and set a good example for her kid. And that bringing my dog into it was super unnecessary.  Backstory- In my line of work we get paid once a month. I’ve been out with covid plus I had an emergency recently that made me have to blow my savings, so not only do I have to wait longer but my check will be smaller too. I’m already on edge and my dog has maybe 3 cups worth of food left before I have to use my final 16 bucks on a $15 bag for her. I can barely even feed myself and our public transport system doesn’t extend to the closest food bank.

My partner and I both agreed we would have a small wedding (it will only be us two and the two required witnesses) and (after suggestions from family) to have a small party the following weekend for family and friends to celebrate the occasion with us. Nothing fancy. We want to avoid the stereotypical drama and hassle and all-around rush of the average wedding day, and to not spend several thousands of pounds on it.   My partner and I have of course been talking about such a thing since we got engaged and we had mentioned a venue we both liked, though only through conversation between ourselves.   My sibling and their partner have recently begun to plan their wedding for 2025 (bearing in mind they got engaged a month ago), and similarly this month my partner and I booked our wedding (for this year) and went to book the venue. We already have our rings.       This is where the issue arises – the venue we want to book for a small family party is the same venue they have booked for their 2025 wedding.       Now, my main reasons behind choosing this venue are:  \- It’s in the local area and I don’t drive,  \- It’s good value for money,  \- It has good parking (half of my family are elderly or disabled or live relatively far away)  \- It's one of the few suitable venues that have overnight rooms that myself and my partner wanted to book,  \- It's one of the only suitable venues that don’t have general public drinking and eating in (we want a quiet, closed-off family gathering),  \- It’s one of the only suitable places still available as most are now booked for Christmas parties (we are saying our vows in early December)  To my genuine surprise, my sibling had a meltdown and threatened to cancel their wedding, and my sibling’s partner messaged me ‘kicking off’ in a family group chat (though never mentioned this concern to me directly, or before the outburst), there’s now drama and stress emanating from most close family members, and so on.   I have simply said we will just cancel our party and not have one at all. My partner and I are happy to just say our vows and be wed, but pressure/suggestions from family initially made us think that having a small family get-together would be nice for all.   So…   **AITA** for wanting the same venue for my 2023 wedding afterparty as my sibling is having for their 2025 wedding?   Note - I asked myself ""what would I do if it was the other way around"" and genuinely I would not be bothered in the slightest if they had their wedding first and used a venue we wanted to use, too. especially if it was 2-3 years prior. I'm baffled because we have been historically a very close-knit family and have always been able to rely on one another within reason."

She informed me that Daughter had had three odd but short  episodes where she was shaking (arms and legs). She also said not to worry or rush off to the doctor, just see what happens. I was more than a little upset that no one had called me when it happened the first time. Later that day,  it happened again, so I called her doctor. On his recommendation, I took her to the local children’s hospital. While there, it happened again and the doctor said that it appeared to have been a seizure. He set up a referral to a neurologist.   My daughter has not been back to school since then. They were on winter break for three weeks and Daughter just recently “settled down” with the seizures and random sicknesses.   I told my husband I wasn’t sure if I felt comfortable sending her back to school because they didn’t call me or an ambulance or anything. He said that it wasn’t a big deal because she is only away from home for three hours, three days a week. He also said I was being a shitty helicopter mom for keeping her from something that did appear to be helping because I was afraid. He very well may be right and I’m just too upset that I wasn’t told the first time she had a seizure until three hours later. I’m just having a hard time entrusting Daughter to them again.

Then the girl was in the apartment not even two weeks later.   The months go by and everything is fine, but then the girl starts to bring her girlfriend over every weekend and sometimes also on weekdays.   During that time my mental health was screwed and I also began to seek more of God.  So imagine this: you're trying to read the Bible or you're having an anxiety attack about to pick up a knife and kill yourself, and in the background, you hear two girls having sex with moans and screams straight out of an adult movie, how would you feel?   I always told my boyfriend to tell her to please remember that she doesn't live alone and that the walls are very thin.  But she kept on doing them things.   A few months go by and even as I tried ""not to mind"" I couldn't, and my depressed brain wasn't helping either. So one day I kinda got tired of the disrespect and I told my boyfriend to talk to her to see if she could move back in with her mother.    That's where the show started!  She went to her mom to say that I hated her for being ""gay.""  And the situation was no longer about respect, but about me being ""homophobic.""  The mother, said unforgivable things to me, saying that I was judging her daughter and that the Bible it says not to judge.  She also told me that no matter what I do I will always be in sin.  In all of this, the girl never came directly to me to talk to me, she always went to her mother, and her mother never came to me either, but to my boyfriend to tell him what the girl was saying.    In the end, the girl left the apartment in a bad way saying that ""she would not accept that I treat her and her girlfriend that way.""  I tried to send a message directly to her explaining that I was not judging her, and that I was going through a mental and spiritual process.  And she ignored the message for several days and then she wrote to me saying ""she was looking for the right words"", just to tell me to f off and that neither I nor my boyfriend ever speak to her again.  I wanted to leave it like that but weeks passed and I felt so guilty for causing that problem with my boyfriend and her sister, and I decided to apologize to her, thinking that she was going to ignore me. But no, she sent me a tremendous text, that even made me shed some tears, telling me that I put her and ""her family in a difficult situation"" and that ""she'll forgive me not because of me but for her sake"" and of course that she thought she made it clear for me and my boyfriend to never to speak to her again.

Two days ago, i sent him back a jokeful audio of me insulting him back (nothing racially offensive, or anything)  and he went crazy with almost 60 text messages insulting me. My best friend got mad and sent him a message telling him to stop seriously, but, to my surprise, when he said it was a ""joke"" my friend inmediately forgave him and started calling him cute and childish for being ""mad"" like that.

For the record I am absolutely not homophobic. A have several family members and good friends who are gay. My uncle was one of the first openly gay men in the village I grew up in the Netherlands. He came out when I was 7 years old,  but the funny thing is the entire family already knew. So I grew up in a very tolerant environment.  So it kind of hurt me when I was banned for homophobia.

Jenna is married and has a two year old, she is a SAHM because she is disabled. She lives on the west coast in a small apartment with her family. Megan lives with me and attends university, she is currently in her first year of obtaining a master's.   Recently, Jenna's husband lost his job and they cannot afford rent on Jenna's disability. Jenna asked my parents if they could move home, I overheard the conversation while visiting my mom and offered for Jenna to move in with me since my parents home is small and in a small town with few job options. Jenna happily agreed and said they would move in at the end of this month since their landlord is allowing them to break the lease since they've been good tenants for 7 years.   Now the way my house is set up is important. I have a three floor home, the upstairs is completely renovated into a mil suite. It has a small kitchen, a bedroom, a smaller bedroom, a small living room and a bathroom with a tub. My first floor is irrelevant. However my basement has a bar, family room, a bedroom and then a huge room with a small bedroom and small bathroom with a standing shower in it. The basement is completely finished. The huge room is probably 1k sq feet. We were going to turn this room into a home gym so it has nice flooring with thick padding underneath. The small room bedroom attached can fit a full size bed but not a queen.  With that said Megan and her dog live in the upstairs room. She does not use the kitchen for anything, I cook all her meals for her since she busy with school. So when I told her Jenna was moving in I said she was going to get moved to the basement room since Jenna would use the kitchen and the division of the two rooms would allow her and her husband some level of normalcy.   Megan flipped out and said that what I was expecting is wrong since she has lived there longer and she is tired of everyone catering to Jenna all the time. She doesn't want to be in a nasty basement with bugs and not have carpet. She didn't feel like moving anything and wanted to take baths (we still have a bath on the first floor she could use). I told her my husband would move the large objects and I'll help her pack everything.  Herr strong emotional reaction is making me feel like i would be an asshole if I made her move. My husband is very much on it's our house and it's our decision. Jenna has no clue what room she is getting so she probably won't be disappointed either way but I feel like logically the basement makes more sense for Megan, especially because she can take the dog for a walk easier this way. I however only have a few days to get this figured out.   I'm not sure though WIBTA for making her switch rooms?"

We were assigned flatmates who really enjoyed cooking and baking together and became best friends. She actually introduced me to her brother “John” (35M) whom I dated and eventually married 8 years ago. We have 2 kids age 3 &amp; 5. Mary was trilled for us, she had a close relationship with John, and remained best friends with me.   John is very intelligent, and a bit competitive in nature, so he naturally went into an intense career field. Unfortunately he turned towards alcoholism to cope with an intense job. He started seeing a therapist who helped him identify his triggers, he drank less, and then he quit therapy think he was fixed. He started drinking more again after awhile. He did the “find a therapist, control his drinking, quit therapy” process 4 times over 5 years. Each time he’d make promises and agreements. We had 2 kids along the way, the first before I realised how serious the drinking problem was, and the second after he agreed to quit completely and get fully sober. He went back on that promise and said he wanted to be in control of his drinking and only have 1-2 drinks a week.   He never got completely sober. He’d flake out on promises to the kids and me, he’d go out with friends who encouraged him to drink and have 2-3 drinks and then start buying bottles of vodka and gin again. After the 3rd time he quit therapy I gave him an ultimatum, get sober or I was leaving him and taking the kids. I followed through with it.  Mary and I stayed best friends after college but John asked me to keep his drinking from his sister the first time around and didn’t want her to think he had a problem. He was my husband so I agreed if he worked on staying sober. When I divorced him, it appeared out of the blue to Mary and their parents who couldn’t understand why I would up and leave her brother and adamantly take the kids only letting him have visitation. Mary blamed me for the divorce and wanted to end our friendship so I told her the truth: that I loved him and still do but I wasn’t willing to spend the rest of my life and ruin my kids childhood setting ourselves up for disappointment over and over again when he wouldn’t stay in therapy or stay sober.   Mary was horrified after I told her about everything. She got very emotional when I admitted to her how many times I let myself get excited for plans her brother made with me or the kids only to be flaked on when her brother poured himself a drink after work. She went to give John a piece of her mind and asked him to get his shit together. John’s now extremely upset at me for spilling his secret that I’d promised to keep because “Mary’s image of him is now rubbish” and his parents are disappointed in him too. I think I had a right to explain myself to my best friend, and I no longer had a promise to keep after he broke his end of it. AITA?"

I come from an immigrant family to the US and am the eldest son. I have been out of college and working for a few years. My younger brother is currently in college, with tuition about 15k a year. My father’s work had been disrupted due to COVID, doesn’t earn much anymore. My mother has a humble but stable job earning a bit above the US national average. They live in a HCOL area but are moving to a LCOL area in a few months.   I went to college with a massive financial aid. My parents contributed 20k in total and also offered to pay for a one-year graduate program (25k). Right after college and grad school, I worked an entry level job in my field and split my brother’s private high school tuition with my parents (20k from me). My parents claimed that the public school I had gone to deteriorated and insisted on private school. I contributed so my brother would be in the best position to get into a good school with financial aid. I also didn’t pursue some further personal education so that I can ensure I have enough money to pay it forward to my brother (including a couple other reasons).  Since starting therapy during COVID, I have learned that my parents (especially my mother) have narcissistic, toxic, gaslighting tendencies. My parents refuse to accept my new outlook on life and have said unhinged things to me and my fiancé. I don’t associated much with my parents nowadays. Unfortunately, my brother has not reached my stage of self-awareness. He agrees with a lot of their beliefs and relies on them financially. I couldn’t care less, as I don’t judge him. I mention this as context for our complicated family dynamic.  My brother has asked if I can contribute to his college tuition, citing my father’s less work, my parents’ reduced income, and that I have a better paying job today. I feel immense guilt, since my parents have contributed to my university costs. But I am riddled with anxiety financially. I told my brother that I have: an old car that needs repairs soon or be replaced, a wedding to pay for (my fiancé and I are paying for the majority ourselves), I have my own house to take care of, I have some recent physical health issues, my fiancé and I are considering starting a family of our own.   While my parents current income is lower than when I went to college, they have some retirement investments (extra properties, etc.) they have made. Apparently there are investments for me as well. I have told my brother that my parents should liquidate anything in my name and that I can sacrifice this for his education. I’m more than happy “pay back my debt” this way and stop being told I owe something.  I am going back and forth emotionally on what to do. It’s not impossible for me to contribute something towards my brother college tuition. But it would cause me anxiety with other payments coming up and I’m not sure who would help me if things went south (besides my fiancé). AITA for telling him I can’t support him right now?

The manger kinda knows me. We talk a bit every once and a while, so I'm on his good side. Basically, the manager said he took note of that and it was kinda left there when I left today.

We are renters and our landlords pay for snow removal services for us.   So Wednesday evening, we receive a text notification from the snow removal company saying they will dispatch trucks at 2 am. We do not have a garage and parking both our cars in the driveway leaves no space for the plows to clear, so I decided to park my car in the street in front of our house. The city placed a barking ban between 10am and 6pm the following day so I figured as long as I move my car back to the driveway by 10 the next morning, I'll be fine.   9 am the next morning rolls around and I go outside to move my car. My neighbour (M35ish) two houses down is standing in his driveway yelling that I can't park my car there. I apologize, thinking this is some sort of etiquette on this street I wasn't aware of and continue clearing my car. As I'm doing this, my neighbour starts plowing THE STREET and spaying the snow onto me. I at first assume he just didn't see me and brush it off but he then yelled ""I'm gonna blow all this snow onto your driveway!"" as he continue to spray ME. I didn't confront him and went inside to get my partner. While I was in there I saw him hit my parked car with his snowblower (no damage or anything) and then blow snow from the street onto my car I had *just* cleared off.   I went back out to move the car (this time with my partner) and the neighbour sent his wife over to talk to us. She was much more pleasant but kept asking us to move the car (which we were clearly attempting to do).

I ask him if he’s for sure good with being with someone like her. He gets very uncomfortable when I am going through my own episodes and tries to end the convo or talk around it. He assures me he’s ready for it so I tell him what I would need and what he should do/say. No problems yet.  Fast forward a couple weeks of not seeing him and I see on his Facebook page that him, Dina and our close friend Greg (26M) drinking at a bar. The next time we hang out I ask both of them why they’re taking Dina to bars if she’s recovering from alcoholism and they tell me that she drinks less when they’re with her. I argued that they’re only making her problem worse. Dina finds us at the bookstore we were at, Greg texted her what I said, and she ends up screaming at me how I need to stay out of her life.  Another month later John is almost cut out from my life. He won’t hang out with the group anymore. Greg solely hangs out with John and Dina now.

He won’t pick up so I decide to go to John’s mom’s house as he still lives with her. Turns out he left late at night and didn’t tell anybody. Just packed up, left and blocked his family members. Through her Instagram I found out where he lives now and confront him. She shows up and ends the convo by literally screaming “AHH!” At the top of her lungs.  Fast forward again two months and I get a call from John. He caught her in bed with a rando she met at the bar. I leave class to go talk with him. He explains that she was so upset that she had to have Greg drive her to her parents’ house in a neighboring city. She sent him many texts saying how he needs to forgive her or her depression will act up again.  I instruct him to call her parents who then saw the horrible/graphic texts and then commit her to a mental facility. She says I ruined her life. John is slowly recovering from the experience. Greg blames me for ruing Dina’s life. My younger brother (24) says I should have minded my own business.

I've never really gotten on Simon's bad side, but as for Nick, he would constantly berate me in a joking way, saying I would never get any girls and stuff of the like. I woudl return the joke and he would get very upset. I learned to take his jokes but never to return them. This year he called me his ""Nonbiological brother that he never wanted but had anyways"".  &amp;#x200B;  The story: This past winter break, I had caught feelings for a girl named Sarah, as well as a case of COVID that was killing my throat. We would text everyday and on Christmas Eve, we had planned to talk, but it was 3pm and she worked from 5pm-11pm, so I decided to ask Nick if I should start a conversation. He then began to ask which girl this was, and I told him it was Sarah. He then began to bring up every girl I had talked with or liked, making a joke out of what was supposed to be a quick question.  Eventually he asked ""Or was it the girl that was Simon in a wig"", to which I texted back ""No every girl I've liked is skinny."" Nick promptly blew up and I defended myself saying it was a light joke, and that Simon had joked worse about himself. Christmas Eve passed without a response.  Christmas Day comes. No Merry Christmas. I refused to wish him a Merry Christmas because I wanted him to start the conversation after he had practically shut down the last one. I recover from COVID. It's now New Year's Eve, so I text a few people, asking how their 2022 was, including Nick. He leaves me on read.  I see this and proceed to lay into him for overreacting and not practicing forgiveness or at least telling me what I did was wrong, letting me apologize. I then tell him I'd rather not lose him as a friend and would love to exit 2022 on good terms. He ignores me until January 5, when he then leaves me on read. I try to call him, but no luck.  I eventually call Simon and explain things, but Simon sees I was only joking, not actually being insulting, and he forgives me. He then talks to Nick, and comes back to me with the following:  1. When Nick called me his nonbiological brother that he never wanted, he meant it in the literal sense 2. Apparently Nick has had unspoken aggressions against me ever since 9th grade but never wanted to voice them 3. Nick had no interest in talking to me or accepting any of my words  So I, very hurt and betrayed, respond, and tell Simon that I have been trying my best to reconcile this, and if it's unreconcilable, I will allow the friendship to dissolve, ONLY IF Nick tells me himself that he doesn't want to be my friend.

Names changed, obviously. Some context, as I know it’s confusing. In our friend group, one couple usually hosts a fair amount of parties throughout the year. Their big party that they throw is Halloween, as it is the wife (Katie)’s favorite holiday. For many years now, me (36F) and my husband (40m) has hosted and thrown a St. Patty’s day party. I am very proud of my Irish heritage, and it has always been a good time.   In 2020, we did not throw a St. Patty’s Day party because 1. I gave birth in February and 2. The world caught on fire. In 2021 and 2022, it still was not very safe (we are in the US). During these years, Katie did not throw a St. Patty’s Day party.   I was very excited that it is safe enough for us to host the party this year, like we have done in the past. I had a fair few issues being a new mom and not really feeling like myself, or that I was anything more than Baby’s Mom. Getting to interact with my friends again like this and hosting was a BIG thing I was looking forward to doing.   The issue? A few weeks ago (the week between Christmas and New Year’s), I got a FB invite to a St. Patty’s Day party that Katie and her husband are hosting. On Saturday March 18th…exactly when I would have hosted (I always do the Saturday closest to the day). I’m not afraid to admit that I actually cried sitting at my desk at work over this. I don’t know if it was intentional or what, but it really made me feel like utter crap. I know it seems silly, but I was looking forward to getting a small piece of myself back by hosting the party. But now I feel like it would be petty, or read wrong if I were to create my event and invite everyone…as it would force people to choose where to go to…and I feel a lot of people will go to Katie’s since she made her event first. I also don’t want to make the invite and purposefully exclude Katie and her husband, as that reads very petty to me. But I’m sitting here WEEKS later, still wanting to do what has become MY tradition, and is known to be my tradition in our group of friends.  So reddit, WIBTA if I still planned my party as it’s my tradition?"

Our family migrated to this place 15 years ago. When I was his age, I faced a lot of fierce verbal/physical bullying due to my weight, facial deformity, birth/language/race of origin. This combined with the fear of arranged marriage, a taunt used by my mother to get me to behave each time I made any sort of mistake, made me make a very weak decision to off myself when I turn 28 when I was 10. Due to that ""plan"", I never fully put effort into anything I did because I didn't see the point. It also didn't help how I was always seemed to be distracted (overtime got soft-diagnosed with ADHD). Obviously I don't have the same intentions anymore, in the past year I actually did put a lot more effort in making something for myself.   Anyway, it's been about 8 months since my brother had been improving his grades and got into an excellent secondary school. Initially they were against my involvement but I fiercely pushed, and overtime they became okay with it. Now they say how they're gonna depend on me completely for the rest of his secondary education. Recently my parents have been going along the lines of ""aww you're doing all the things you missed out on as a kid"" or ""I see that you're ensuring your brother doesn't make the same mistakes you did"". And everytime they talk about him, they always have to say something about me in a pitiful tone which honestly feels so condescending. I don't like how they always feel the need to include me when he should be rightfully getting the attention, but I don't know why it makes me seethe with rage so much. I told them how they're to never include my past whenever talking about them and they've been saying how I made them feel bad. Am I overreacting here, AITA?  TLDR: Parents constantly keep comparing my unfortunate shitty past to my sibling, which not only makes me mentally suffer but also literally rains on his parade. I hate how they ruin each moment so I essentially told them stfu and to never talk about my past when we're talking about how my brother's doing well"

She has a history of going against my wishes because “she’s an adult and can do what she wants”. She had a difficult childhood and has not received any help in dealing with her trauma, so we collectively just put up with her behavior. I have dealt with this by moving away and being low contact, but we do see each other at least once a month so she can spend time with my child (8M). The story: A few weeks ago, she was at my house and found a pregnancy test, and asked me about it. I confirmed that I was very newly pregnant and didn’t want to tell anyone else because it was VERY early. I explicitly asked her not to tell me Dad because I wanted to be there when he found out, and I knew he would immediately tell everyone else he knows. She agreed and said she understood completely. Today, I told her everything was looking good so I’d be comfortable if we told my Dad. The conversation went like this: Mom:”I already told him” Me: *deep breath* “why?” Mom: “It was on the ride home from you house last week, or maybe it was sooner than that, but the point is I waited” Me: “It doesn’t matter that you waited, I explicitly asked you not to.” Mom: “I could have lied and said he didn’t know, at least I told you now” Me:”That doesn’t make it better. And Dad would have told me the truth. You absolutely knew I didn’t want anyone else to know” Mom:”Well I definitely think you should be the one to tell your brother.” Me:……*deep breath*”Do you not understand why I’m upset about this?” Mom: “No” Me:”Have a good day” *click* I. Am. Livid. Not only did she take away that moment with me and my Dad, but she has no understanding of why  that was not Ok or why I would be hurt. Here’s where I may wrong: In a month we are supposed to go away for the weekend with her and my son. I cannot trust her to take him by herself because she gives him things he’s not medically allowed to have and completely ignores me when I try to set boundaries. This was kind of a final straw moment for me and I really do not want to go. I feel like I shouldn’t be as upset because I knew in my heart that she was probably going to tell him because of her pattern of behavior. I’m more upset about the way she reacted after telling me that she had broken my trust. My son has no idea we were planning to go away, and I can take him away another weekend. WIBTA if I cancel?"

I'm used to the gawking and suspicious stares when I'm out with my kids. When we got to the outlet she had to use the restroom. The family restroom was occupied and she really had to go so I sent her into the ladies' room. I waited right outside of the doorway, just a little off to the side so I couldn't see in when the door opened but would be right there when she came out.  While I'm waiting a woman had come up, gave me an odd stare and asked why I was just standing outside of the ladies' restroom. I explained I was waiting for my daughter to come out and she offered to go inside and watch her. I declined because I have had one too many negative experiences with people who said they meant well only to try getting my kids to admit I was kidnapping them, sneak them out to 'safety', and the like. That shit gets exhausting though I understand their intentions are good. She asks why not, where's their mother, what's my daughter's name, what does she look like, giving me this whole shakedown. So I get fed up and loudly go ""Lady stop trying to creep on my kid in the restrooms!"" It got her to leave me alone and she left. My kid came out, we went to the stores she wanted, got her a bear made and went to pick up my other two kids. I aired my frustration about the incident and similar ones to my parents. My father got a kick out of it but my mother felt like I shouldn't have done it and embarrassing the woman like that was a step too far when she was trying to look out for my kid so I should've just answered her questions."

Since the pandemic hit I've heard non stop of people selling pictures of their feet and doing really well at it, like actually earning enough to make a living out of it. Curiosity got to me and a few days ago I started to look into it and actually started to think about signing up and giving it a try, after all, it's just my feet. I don't really see it as anything completely inappropriate, it's just feet to me... When my boyfriend called me today,  I told him I might sign up to do this, the whole while laughing and make it light hearted, like I was being mischievous,  but he was super serious, asking ''are you serious about this? are you joking?!'' Total mood switch I told him, ''yeah, I've been seeing that people make a lot of money like this, and it's just my feet'' and he answered ''well, I'm gonna start selling pictures of my penis then'' I told him it's definitely not the same thing. He then started saying ''wow, I just don't think I like the idea of having a girlfriend porn star''. I was totally taken aback by this and his reaction, honestly I thought he'd find it funny. After that the conversation just turned completely awkward, I told him seriously if it bothered him that much of course I wouldn't do it, his reply ''do whatever you want'' took me a while to get him to actually admit that it would bother him. So I dropped the conversation and he just said ''I'll call you later''   I feel super weird about it now.

I liked the love letters you sent but at some point they all started to sound the same every single time. You always gave me hearts whether they were paper or wood which i rlly didnt like bc i just dont like most handmade things, esp when theyre useless. I thank you for giving me a christmas gift and a birthday (September) gift, but the gifts rlly made me realize that it does not feel like you know me in the slightest. The doughnut cd and jeongyeon pcs were amazing but they were things i explicitly told you about and you couldve just given me them. The pc mat (given cus I knew they were getting a pc) was also good although i dont know exactly whether it was accidentally good bc i just feel like you wanted to get me smth from pusheen.

You may feel like im overcritical about this but i put a lot of emphasis on someones actions when deciding if im attracted to someone or not and gifts are very important actions to me. I told you on sumone later (after Christmas) that hate handmade gifts but you seemed to just ignore it.   Let me just do the rundown on them: the (self crocheted) bee was nice but not my thing personally, i alr had the bottle, the puzzle was just frankly bad it was unsolveable and it had a generic message and it was handmade, the wooden hearts were just lazy and shouldntve even be considered a gift, the (selfmade) doughnuts were nice but i personally dont like getting food on a holiday except for candy or chocolate but what was really the last drop in the bucket was the my little pony drink. I may sound a little irritated when i talk about this but thats because i rlly was. Just because i like mlp doesnt mean i want a fucking kids drink with a kinder egg surprise toy which wasnt even fucking decent and the drink was shit. U dont have to know me properly to know that i DO NOT want that. Then also that one date u planned. The cat cafe wouldve been good but the cats werent affectionate at all and that mightve been nice if it wasnt my first cat cafe ever and then u also planned to go to a soup thing (we didn't end up going to) with a deaf owner when neither of us can properly speak sign language and i dont even like soup.  Im just pointing out specific things to say that it felt like i was the only one who was actually putting in effort to know the other. I know i share a lot about myself without someone having to ask but that doesnt mean thats all there is to me.

Fall 2022 I was a nanny but the kids worked hard to get me fired and literally didn’t listen to a word I said so I needed to find something different. I accepted a part time job at a local coffeeshop. I took a huge pay decrease and went from full time to part time. I only took this knowing I would find a full time job as soon as possible. After paying my bills, I have less than $40 each check. $40 for two weeks. Every other friday is payday at the coffeeshop so I knew today (1/27) that I could fill up my gas tank.   Well today comes and I have an interview 25 miles away (which is fine, I don’t mind a 30 min drive) but for some reason I didn’t get paid from the coffeeshop. I emailed the owner and he didn’t get payroll done in time so now pay day is 1/31. So I have 50 miles on my car to get to the interview and back. 25 miles each way.   I texted my mom and asked her if I could trade cars with her today for my interview and in exchange I would pick my sister up from school (a task we all dread) and she said no because she had a dr appointment. Fair. I told her I would figure it out, maybe doordash in the area after my interview. She says sorry I have no cash or I would give you some money. I get in my car and see that im not at 50 miles but 42. Fuck. I told my mom this and her response is “take the side streets home so you don’t breakdown on the highway.”   My parents use zelle. I’ve had a job since I was 16 and since then I’ve paid for everything on my own. My sister (19) is the same way. But my brother is 17 and doesn’t work or pay for anything.

It’s not that she can’t zelle me $10 to get home, she doesn’t want to. She knows I have no money and 42 miles in my car to drive 50+ miles.   So my plan was to try to donate plasma after my interview (I got the job and will be working full time!) and use the money in my tank. Well I ran out of gas before I could even make it to CSL plasma. On the way to the interview was a really bad wreck so I had to detour, took an extra 8 miles off. So I had to call my Grandpa to come help me. But my parents havent talked to him in 2017 because he cheated on my grandma. So now my mom is pissed at me for reaching out to him. But what was I supposed to do?

Ever since i was like 16-17 and i had a huge glowup dads friend whos a photographer wanted me to model but dad never let me and always said , once you turn 18, sure, i turned 18 and then he said no again , i realized that the ""when u turn 18 "" was an excuse and he was hoping that i let it go but i didnt and when i turned 18 i wanted to do it.. I stayed good and didnt do it ,even tho i kinda wanted to, im 19 , turning 20 in november,and i broke..I wanted to do it so much and it got to a point where dads friend was asking me to do it and saying stuff about how good it would be almost every month and i also followed him on instagram where he posted pics about shoots he did, and everytime i saw it i was like ah that could be me.  I told dads friend okay im doing it but dont let dad know , dont tell him and dont post about it.We did the photoshoot last weekend , everything went smoothly except one thing that i will later talk about it was kinda hot to me atleast..  We did the pics, few outfits, simple white background , no brand deal or anything , just for me to try modeling and for him to boost his portfolios , and my portfolio.  (the hot thing:I forgot my fiji , and its a 20 minute train plus 2 min bus drive plus 10 minute walk back home so i wanted to go back for it quickly, i didnt even close the door yet , i quickly went back to the kitchen area , didnt even make any sounds i wanted to be quick cuz if i dont catch my train i have to wait an hour for the next, and as i walk out and quickly walk past the photoshoot set, i see him with his headphones on ,sitting in front of his laptop, putting some creme or idk what it was on his hands , while his pants are already on the floor ,staring at the pics that we did, i went home and ill be honest it turns me on to this second still,thinking about that)  BUT ANYWAYS  When i got back  I told him if he wants to post anything anywhere , block my dad before he does it , and dont send it to him or whatever.  Next week comes by , he messages me that my dad was acting strange, when they hung out (i only see dad in the weekends so i didnt really see anything) , and that hes scared my dad might have seen it.

We got into an argument years ago that I can never forget or forgive that has left our relationship sour.  This is the main point. He lives in a different country and is going over with my mum in law. I do get along well with her. Usually we would receive them both in our house but this time he wants to bring his girlfriend. He's been seeing this lady for 18 months and most likely will marry her one day. I've never spoken to her or seen her.  My husband ask if all three could stay and if this was ok but my response was no we don't have the space and don't really want a stranger staying with us but we could accommodate for those two weeks if we absolutely had too.  AITA for not allowing my husband brother girlfriend to not stay with us for two weeks but will receive him and their mum.

After I came home from school I decided I wanted to go to my grandmas house.   It was really fun we watched a movie and all. After a while I decided I wanted to go home so I took my stuff and said bye to my grandma and everything.  When I came home my mom and step-dad were also home. When I came home I said hello and stuff. And my mom without skipping a beat said “why r u home so early?” I said to her that I just felt like coming home now. She rolled her eyes for no reason.  I put all my stuff away and walked into the kitchen. My mom was standing there talking to my step-dad. When I was standing in the door frame she said to me “u probably wanted to go home to watch that shitty phone in ur room” and I said back “no? I just felt like coming home” and she said that I was only gone for 5 hours.. she was very rude for absolutely no reason.  She started going off on how I am so addicted to my phone and I was lazy. And since I take everything super seriously I obviously started crying. I ran to my room and cried in my bed when I suddenly heated something. I went to the kitchen with tears in my eyes when I noticed that my mom was crying her eyeballs out. She later on the floor crying. I asked my step-dad about it and he said that she is just “tired” I still feel guilty to this day.  AITAH?

I was screaming, crying, etc. I'm 29(f) and I found out I was pregnant two months ago. I naturally assumed we would keep the baby because we had talked about it in the past but as of 3 weeks ago, my fiance pulled a line of ""Well I don't know if we should go through with this because how will Molly feel?"" Molly is his 2 year old dog who has separation anxiety and won't let me husband out of eye sight without destroying the house trying to get to him. So he was truly all for terminating our pregnancy in favor of his dog, despite us discussing the possibility of kids for 3 years and him always saying that he has ""always wanted kids"". I lost quite a bit of respect that day and have honestly absolutely hated this dog since then. Her behaviors drove me mad before but now I can't even stand to be in the same room as her. And no, it's not just her. It's him too. I've been so stressed about all of this.   Well, I miscarried. I found out 2 days ago and I'm a complete mess over it. I don't want to talk to anyone. I don't want my fiance anywhere near me either. He didn't even like try to comfort me outside of saying ""I'm sorry"" and hugging me for two seconds. So now I just sit in the shower and cry about it because it's the only place I can get away from his and his fucking animal.   Well, today I was laying in bed awake and just staring off. He comes over and tries snuggling up to me and the dog immediately jumped up on the bed and climbed between us whining. He then starts coddling the dog, talking in baby voice and saying ""give momma loves, momma needs the lovin's"". I told him to stop. I told him to stop multiple fucking times. He then said ""babe she just wants to make you feel better"". I flipped out completely. Everything came out where I told him I fucking hated that animal. I hated the fact that he would have chosen that dog over our baby that just died inside me. I hated that he insisted on calling me the dogs mother when IM NOT and I had the chance to be a real mother and now it's gone and I didn't want that fucking dog or him anywhere near me because he's an insensitive prick for not seeing how much this has destroyed me. I was freaking out. I have said all this to him in small intervals already but he never listened apparently. I just left. I've refused to answer any of his calls. I refuse to go back to that house and be near him and the mutt that invades my space. My father seems to think I pushed it too far though, stating that men are incapable of feeling the emotions as deeply as women do. Weird because he seems to feel a whole lot about his dog but not his kid that just died in me. AITA?"

Fiancé’s mom (late 50s, f) is very involved in our lives. Before the fight, she was coming over weekly for dinner, we would visit her on the weekends, and she would occasionally watch the kids when we wanted a night out. For reference, my relationship with future MIL has been rocky. She is moody, racist, and homophobic. I have tried very hard to get past this in recent years for the sake of the kids.   She has been in a “mood” lately, as she typically is this time of year. She’s been crabby to me and the rest of the family but, again, I have let it go. However, I snapped when it started affecting my kids. This built up over time. There were a few incidents where she told my son that he couldn’t play baby dolls with my daughter and said they shouldn’t even be in his toy box. Then, she told him he couldn’t be “princess fiona” when they were playing pretend. And finally, when we were at her house, she yelled at the kids for not eating the crackers she gave them and told them in a really nasty voice to “stop wasting her food.”  I didn’t say anything during these incidents. I tried to just let it roll off my back because in the past, conflict with future MIL has affected my relationship with fiancé. I assured both kids later that they could play however they wanted and not to worry about not finishing their food. But it ate away at me. I felt like I didn’t protect my kids because I kept quiet in the moment. After a week or so I was full of rage and anger towards her. She came over last weekend with my fiancés sister (27f) and brought the kids each a toy. She gave the toys to them and specifically said that Ethan gets the “boy one” and Lily gets the “girl one.” I fucking exploded. Went full mama bear mode. I immediately yelled at her and said, in short, that I’m sick of the gender role bullshit, we don’t think that way in our house and that I’m done with her moodiness. I was not nice about it. Everyone was shocked. She grabbed her shit and ran out the door and I ran after her. In the moment, I don’t know what I was trying to do but I saw fucking red. All of the pent up anger was just pouring out. She got in her car and drove away and I went on a long walk to cool off.   When I got back, my fiancé was fuming that I blew up at his mom, especially in front of the kids. I guess my son started crying when I left and asked if grandma was bad. I fucked up in the way that I handled the situation. I should have pulled her aside and gave it to her privately, not in front of the kids. But it was literally a knee-jerk reaction. I’m not necessarily asking if I’m the asshole for acting the way I did, because I probably am. But AITA for getting as angry as I did over something my fiancé and his sister are calling “trivial”, “not a being deal”, and just “how she is?”"

My department have always had a fractured relationship with Business Development (basically Sales), even before my time.  One of my clients, I'll call Alice (30sMtF) transitioned late last year and changed her name. I updated her name in our database with no issues. A few days later I noticed that we kept Alice's title as Mr (title lives in a completely different section and I completely missed it). I immediately put in a request for it to be changed to Ms, as that's the title I know she uses. All requests go through the CRM manager (57M), part of the Sales team. He hasn't approved the change since last November. Early in the month I followed up with him and received this reply: 'Oh come on! We're so busy. We don't use titles in any communication issued externally anyway. Haven't time for this.'  I showed his reply to my boss (50M) and although he didn't agree with it he told me not to escelate it to HR in order not to mess up relationships even further.  Yesterday we had a virtual sensitivity training. To my surprise, this CRM manager was there as a speaker and had a small section to present... At the end, there was a Q&amp;A. I raised my hand (on Teams) and described the situation above with the client without naming names. I then directed my question to the CRM manager and asked 'Would this be completely inappropriate to refuse changing someone's title in the database in this case?'. We then watched him ummimg and ahhing for the next 5 minutes. We were about 120 of us on the call and there's a good chance many people gathered it was him! It was the only question he received as well, as he had such a small part.  After the meeting I received a call from my boss suggesting I was TA and it didn't help the relationship. I asked him to wear his heart on his sleeve and tell me if he was OK with nothing being done about the issue. He told me that he enjoyed watching him fluster but still didn't like what I did. As far as I'm concerned, it didn't help the difficult relationships but just didn't sit well with me letting this slide completely either.  AITA for asking the CRM manager that question?"

He refuses to give up on his dream, which I understand, and refuses to at least consider getting a part-time job somewhere. He has no qualifications, which would make retail or hospitality likely industries, but I think that he feels that they're beneath him.  He does chores when I ask him to.  I've been so stressed due to work, so I booked a holiday for us both. I did so without discussing it with him, because frankly I don't expect him to have any gigs stopping him from going.

I asked my friend who's fluent in Japanese about some help with learning it and he wanted to know my motivation. When I told him about it he told me that he wouldn't be helping me with that and even called me creepy. I feel I misjudged him because I was thinking he'd support me.

Both of us were focusing on our careers and wanted that to come before we decided to start a family. We had an agreement that I would work to put her through school and then, once she got her degree, she would return the favor. This went according to plan, I helped her to get where she wanted to be in her education and she got a job working in her field of choice. After a year, she decided that she no longer wanted to do that and would rather be a stay at home spouse.   I had grown and matured by this point and was totally happy with her for doing what she wanted. At this point I was still paying for all of the bills, all the insurance and everything else, so nothing else changed for me, except for now I was going to have to pay for my own school as well. This put some significant strain on me and I still haven't been able to finish, as I have a demanding job and not very much time to devote to my studies.   About a year ago, my wife decided to get a part time seasonal freelance job in the design field. I told her that was great, but that she would have to save money to pay taxes at the end of the season. She didn't have any obligations, as I pay for everything, so this shouldn't have been an issue for her. This job made her realize that her true desire was to go into design so she wanted to go back to school, which she expected me to pay for again, which I reluctantly agreed to do.   The past three months have been pretty miserable for me because of this decision. I'm paying tuition for two people, all the bills and working full time and to top it off the past three months my wife has been hounding me about getting her pregnant. I literally cannot save money that would be necessary to create a stable environment for a child and I have no time to be a father. I have asked her if she plans to use her degree to help with financials in the future and she replied that she planned to start her own business, but not something that would take too much time away from motherhood.   I don't know if this situation is sustainable in the long term. The tipping point for me has been this tax season, where it turns out ""we"" owe the IRS thousands of dollars for her freelance work and when I asked her for it she shows me her accounts are at zero.

I'd normally be fine with this but I'd been using that guitar for years and was hoping to keep it around for nostalgic pleasure (I hope I used that phrase correctly). Maybe I'm just being petty, but I really didn't want to give it away. Also, I (more realistically, my mum) had given one of my old guitars away to someone else, so, at this point, I felt like I was just being used like a charity shop. I finished my guitar practice and told my mum that I wanted to keep the guitar for previously mentioned reasons. She didn't seem to understand what I was on about and thought it was cruel to keep a guitar from an 11 year old girl.

I didn't say anything at first, hoping it was a one-time deal, but she recently admitted she's fully smoking again and bought a bunch of cigarettes.  I'm disappointed she started a nasty habit that in the past she had been so happy about giving up.

I asked my hubby that instead of gifts etc that we go away somewhere we’d never been as a bit of an adventure just the 2 of us. I was happy to help organise child and pet care but didn’t want to know where and what etc.  This was already a back up plan from the thing I’d originally asked for which was to go away for a couple of days all of us with my parents to Edinburgh to see the only live pandas currently in the UK.  Everyone was initially on board but no plans were made then my parents announced that they’d now booked a trip to Australia for later in the year so are now saving up for that instead.  Over the summer DH’s cousins went away to LA for 1 of their 30th &amp; the other had a huge party. Id also spent over a month with my MIL helping plan and execute an epic surprise 30th for my BIL. (I have few friends and a January birthday so didn’t go down this route &amp; also wasn’t asking to leave the UK)  I’m currently on Mat leave from our second DD and my DH had taken up my mat leave as a second job, replacing the existing 2ndjob he had as this one gave him more time with the babies.   Unfortunately shortly after he took up the new job his mental health took a major hit &amp; he was signed off of work for about 4 months, something that I fully supported- however at the end of this 4month period he decided to go to his (&amp;my) boss of his 2nd job &amp; say that he wasn’t going to be continuing with it as it was causing too much stress &amp; anxiety. Due to this we obviously were down a wage &amp; this coincided with my pay dropping from full pay to stat mat pay leaving us very short financially.   Here’s were I feel like I’m TA - this has meant that any plans for my birthday are now out of the question, nothing. Totally get that my DH mental health is the most important thing but I can’t help but feel salty at the fact that the timing of him quitting his job wasn’t even considered &amp; that nothing had even been planned anyway (I mean it’s not like my birthday was a surprise, it’s the same day every year?!) I’m now feeling pretty devastated &amp; just want 2 sleep my birthday away &amp; ignore that it’s even happening  Plus we were visiting DH side of the family last week, none of them knew I was going to be 30 &amp; preceded to ask why I wasn’t doing a party  My parents aren’t helping by saying he should have planned things &amp; it’s not great etc when they equally have taken the mindset that it’s not a big deal   I know that I’m not entitled to bday celebrations etc but I feel like I always put 100% into planning and making sure everyone else has a great 1 &amp; seem to be left without the same care    I’ve been majorly off with DH &amp; parents, who’ve now realised I’m upset &amp; are trying to back track and make plans for a small meal. But I just don’t want to do anything anymore, I want to forget about the whole thing as it’s too upsetting but now I’m being branded as difficult &amp; awkward  AITA?"

[Medium Length],"I spent months recording some music. My partner knows I tinker with making music sometimes. I write too. I do all kinds of things. But I didn't tell anybody I was working on a couple of songs. I don't usually tell people about things I'm working on, for a number of reasons.  1. It sets an expectation. If something happens and I can't finish the project, I have to explain myself when those people ask whatever happened to that thing I was working on.  2. When I tell someone I'm working on something, I often end up experiencing some of those positive feelings you get from actually accomplishing something. In my case, it negatively impacts my forward momentum.  3. Sometimes I want to surprise someone. It can be fun for me and them and it gives them less time to form expectations. Expectations are a lot of baggage to bring with you in any context.  So, I'm on a drive with my partner (we're using her car for this trip, so she is driving) and she asks if I can be the disc jockey for the trip. I'm going through my phone, queuing up music, and I add one of the songs I did.   It plays and it isn't so bad or amateurish that it stands out. And I often play her music she's never heard (I'm always looking for new music). I ask her what she thinks of the song. She says it's not her thing. I'm a little disappointed to hear that (there are those expectations creeping in) but I don't say anything.  A few days later (yesterday), she walks in as I'm fixing a slight problem with the mix on that same song. She puts it together right away and is upset that I didn't tell her it was my song in the car. I say I wanted an unbiased opinion but she's acting like she said it was shit, which she didn't. She only shrugged and said it wasn't her thing. She says she wishes I would have told her beforehand.  Am I the asshole for not telling her, ""Okay this next song is me!"" and then staring at her as it played?"

I thought a babysitting job would work best since I have younger cousins I used to babysit when I was younger so I have experience. I did NOT get lucky with the kids I babysat unfortunately.  My mom had asked around at work saying that I was looking to babysit and if they knew anyone who needed a babysitter.  Her co-worker's cousin was friend's with a single mom who's babysitter recently moved, and she just needed someone to watch her kids after school.  She has two twins who are both 6M, and yesterday was my first day working. Let's call them Leo and Theo.  I was supposed to pick them up at their bus stop, and the minute they stepped out they were already arguing about stupid shit. When we got to their house, they still wouldn't stop. I asked them nicely to stop and they wouldn't stop blaming each other for who's fault it was and then started fucking arguing more.  I was supposed to make them a snack and I kept offering different foods and they both kept saying no to all my suggestions. I asked them what they want then and they said Mac N cheese and I told them I'm not cooking and they could choose something else if they wanted to. Leo insisted he knew how to make it in the microwave, so I told him he could knock himself out, but he didn't; when he took it out, he accidentally spilled hot water on Theo and also the macaroni was clearly undercooked and just gross looking. They ended up not eating at all.  I told them to go to the couch and watch TV so I could get some hw done, and guess what. They argued. Again.  This time it was over what TV show to watch. Theo THREW THE REMOTE at Leo's head and he started to cry. I told them they better hand me that remote and guess what Theo does. Instead of handing it to me nicely, he throws it at my head too. I told them that's it, I'm leaving, and they both looked like they didn't believe me.  I texted their Mom what happened and that I wasn't staying and she begged me to at least until she got home. I told her I'm not staying in a place I don't even feel safe at, and left.  The twins mom called my mom, and when she got home she yelled at me and said I made her look bad. I told her she literally cares more about how she looks rather than that those kids were acting like complete brats and throwing stuff at people  She's still pretty pissed off, and, maybe I should've put up with it but I seriously was at my breaking point, AITA?"

We sat and ate our meal with the intention of the servers coming to do they’re birthday celebration chant for him at the end. It seemed like they were making seating selections based off of party types (ie, couples, young families, older families, etc.) and they sat a couple of families with kids 5 and under around us as well as a family with a baby &gt;3 months right across from us. This was before we told our server it was his birthday and when I did my husband said I maybe shouldn’t have because of the family across from us. Mind you it was peak dinner rush, the music was very loud and it was just busy in general. I said that it’s already pretty loud in here so I don’t think it’s that big of a deal. So they came over did their birthday thing and left. When we were getting up to leave the mother said it was inconsiderate of us to do that because of their baby being right here. He didn’t fuss and was still snug in his car seat. I told her that it clearly didn’t bother the baby and that if they were worried about the baby waking they should have chose a different restaurant. My husband said it was a little inconsiderate but I don’t think it’s that big of a deal: if you’ve ever been to a Texas Roadhouse you’ll know they’re sometimes super loud but I also understand that as new parents maybe they were in the same boat as us and had no relatives nearby to watch the baby for dinner.

Me and my partner are both in our 30s and planning to get married, so it's serious. I am in regular contact with partner's family, although it's limited mostly to family occasions and polite help when necessary. We get along OK-ish. We've had a number of heated discussions because of our differences. We are (and want to stay) child-free, we're also calm, not outgoing and socially awkward and anxious people. Partner's family is not like that at all and we're both considered weird and different. Typical ""Keeping Up Appearances"" situation.  The problem: a family wedding to which we were both invited, but none of us wanted to go. A big religious ceremony with a huge party afterwards. We both hate weddings! Any family celebrations, where people drink too much, brag all the time, criticize us because we're not like them and force us to have fun while we're literally dying inside and later need 48 hours to get back on our feet again. All family meetings are so fake in our eyes and their only purpose is to show off in front of the others.  Partner complained many times about not having a say about anything in life, about biting one's tongue and going with the flow, just to avoid family drama... Said that they should go to the wedding, but do not want, because they don't approve of many things that happen in the family. I felt the same. As we were the black sheep already, I sad: who cares. I wanted to be a supportive partner, wanted to make my dearest feel like their opinion matters. I asked my partner whether they're not afraid of making the to-be-weds angry, they said it should be fine. They're not close, and I met them just once.  We've let the future couple know, they seemed OK with us not coming. We offered to come visit them after the wedding, and they seemed fond of this idea.  The shit storm was LE-GEN-DA-RY. We've faced backlash from basically the entire family, because it is ""unimaginable"" to not go. Because we've had ""no valid reason to not go"". Because we ""must show we have money to give"". Because tradition is so important here and we ""can't be different"". I couldn't care less about them not liking me, but I now feel so bad for my partner. Never the golden child, now hated even more, and it feels like my fault. Everything would be better (pretty and fake) if I'd made us bite our tongues and suggested that we go no matter what. The newlyweds are ghosting us. Partner says that ""they showed that they true faces"" and seems to shrug it off, but I know there are many unspoken words behind it.  AITA for supporting my partner in being true to one's feelings instead of being wiser and pushing us both to that damned wedding just to avoid the drama?"

We played this soon after we got it and my brother had an ... interesting strategy. I can't remember the actual colors so let's just say that his color to describe was mustard yellow. The first word he used would have been ""egg"" or something. We all placed our pieces either around the yellows or maybe the white/peachish colors.   For his two word description, he would have said something like ""bright sky"", much to our collective confusion. When it turned out that his color was a yellow, we all demanded an explanation. He proceeded to explain that he had decided to say something completely intentionally misleading straight to our faces as the second clue so that we wouldn't get too many points. what the fuck? It would have been one thing if he laughed it off and was like ""oh yeah i cheated sorry"" but he didn't. He insisted that that was allowed and he did nothing wrong. Since then we've argued about it on and off, my parents both think that it's against the spirit of the game. I keep saying that yeah, there isn't a rule against it, but there isn't a rule against swiping everything off the board and throwing a tantrum either! They didn't think they'd have to explain why you shouldn't do that. He is now saying that it's not even against the spirit of the game either, so here I am asking for stranger's opinions.  TL;DR: My brother intentionally gave a completely unrelated clue in a board game where he was supposed to give clues that actually point to the right answer. He doesn't see what's wrong with this."

Mom dealing with BF who doesn't agree with choices," I (31F) have been with my boyfriend (32M) for 7.5 years. I have a son(13) from a different relationship, and a daughter(5) with him. Recently I expressed that I want to go to the gym/dance class 3 evenings a week with my friend (F). I 'm gone for about 2 hours, with the time it takes to drive there/back. He doesn't agree that it's the right thing to do, bc we should be together every night. He complains that sometimes I don't get home from work until 5/5:30 (happens about 8x per month.) I'm a visiting nurse that works 9-5ish. Sometimes I get home earlier, like 3:45/4. I used to do Beachbody workouts at home, but wanted to switch for heavier weights/added benefits. My BF then said he wanted 3 nights a week to ""do whatever he wanted,"" so we agreed that my nights would be M, T, Th and his would be W, F, Sat.   Since my schedule varies, he typically asks what my day looks like. The day after we made the agreement, I let him know what time I would be home and what time I would be heading to the gym. He became pretty quiet - texting one word answers, etc. At home, I could tell that he was upset with me since he avoided eye contact, wasn't speaking to me/short with me. I went to the gym anyway that day and the following, since it was M/T. Now he has been saying that he hates his life, he never gets to do anything bc he is tied to the house and the kids, always working or at home, that I don't spend enough time with them, I'm selfish and only think about myself, etc. I do the entire morning routine with them since he leaves early for work. He gets them off the bus bc I'm working, but I make/cleanup dinner every night, do all the household tasks and take our dogs out 2x/day. I do the bedtime routine unless I ask him to - and often he ""can't"" bc he needs to go to bed.  Adding - I smoke mj, used to be daily when I got home from work, but it makes me anxious in public, so I don't smoke on days that I go to the gym (which is another reason I wanted to switch from at home workouts - because I'd like to quit altogether someday, or at least not be craving it daily.) On W this week, I got home from work late (about 6pm) since someone had an urgent medical need. I smoked when I got home since I wanted to take the edge off the tension - I was getting an attitude from him over text after I told him my visit ran late. He laughed and put ""visit ran late"", like mocking or calling me a liar. I then started making dinner pretty much immediately. My son came in the kitchen, looking for bottled water, and I didn't realize that we had run out. As mentioned before, I get anxious in public if I have smoked, so I told him I couldn't go to the store, to drink juice/milk/tap water instead. He walked out with a cup of juice. My BF started called me a ""scumbag in his book"" because I ""couldn't go to the store because I was HIGH"" - I put that in caps because of the infliction in his voice when he says it.  AITA for wanting to go to the gym 3x a week and smoking mj?"

I’ve never had a great relationship with food, I just don’t enjoy it like so many people do. So eating is more like a chore for me, yet I do my best to eat nutritiously  and to also find things I enjoy.   One thing I do like is French onion soup, at least when I’ve had it a French restaurants. I recently found some at Trader Joe’s and took it out of the fridge today to make it for lunch.  When I removed it from the box, I saw the two servings were packed in little bags - with lil bits inside (seemingly cheese and croutons). Honestly not the most appetizing looking but I was happy to overlook the presentation at this stage.   As I was pattering around the kitchen, my husband came in and we were chatting back and forth. I wasn’t paying full attention to what he was doing, until I realized that he’d picked up one of the bags of soup while remarking how gross it looked. He then proceeded to pretend he was pooping it out and dropped it in the floor.   I was so horrified that he would treat food with such disrespect and also be so ignorant as to how that would put me, or most people if you ask me, off their meal.   I’ve spent a lot of time in economically developing countries, and I’ve witnessed severe poverty which has made me come to treat food with utmost respect- as much as I don’t quite enjoy it myself. I also grew up saying grace before meals and have spent time in numerous spiritual traditions where food is honored and treated as manna from Heaven. I get that not everyone sees it that way, but what he did couldn’t be farther from that.  I yelled at my husband expressing my shock and horror at his immaturity and disrespect for my food, and I said things like “I can’t believe how immature you are”, “Jesus Christ you’re 45 yoa, not a teenager, you need to grow the f@ck up”.

My morning classes are 8:30-11:30 Monday-Thursday about a 10-15 minute drive where I live. My job can also be a 5-10 drive.  Time mainly depends on traffic.  The car is under my moms name. But my stepdad told me when I’m 18 (2 months about) he expects me to move out ASAP and this car won’t be a car I can drive anymore. And that it will be going to my brother (16m)   My mom and stepdad had a whole fight over what he said. Because it’s legally my moms car and she can choose. And with my job I’ll be needing the car more even out of highschool. And that my brother hasn’t paid anything for the car since we got it, he either refuses, or the job market doesn’t want him. I’m not sure. His only income is his game tournaments, idk how much he makes from that. Me and him agreed though that besides his game nights, it’ll be a IOU for gas. But he’s also a shit driver (almost crashed the car on his second drive with me) so I drive him wherever usually.  Me and him both waved the road test (aka we just got our probation license right away, no driving test). But I think I was better at driving because when my parents picked me up from work they made me drive home, even when I had my temps. My brother after driving school didn’t drive at all. It’s probably been almost a year now since driving school  I put roughly $20 of gas in it every week, $45 for insurance monthly. And I’m being told while I pay for this car I’ll have to save for my own. My mom did agree to pay for some of a possible new car, but wants me to take out a loan for paying for it. I think I’m just more mad that my brother gets a free car that I put money into whole I’m expected to buy my own   Me and my mom got into a fight over the car repairs (I just can’t idle it atm) and she needed $500 more to repair it. I told her it’s my money, and not my car. Even if she’d said she’ll pay me back I’m not giving it. She called me selfish that I don’t wanna help her poor mom. After that I’ve been staying at my dads more.   I’ve been hoping to have about 4,500 saved for a car, but it’ll probably be around 2,500-3,000. Idk how much my mom will support on buying one (she has bad spending habits and blown 30,000 in four/five months when she was unemployed)  AITA that I have to pay for this car, while expected to save for my own"

The job market here isn’t terrific, my partner just now got a job yesterday, and I’m still looking.  About a month ago, I ended up asking her if we could move in for a couple months if we can’t make ends meet. She said that she wasn’t comfortable with it, but gave me $600 towards our bills instead. (mom is retired and between her and her spouse, they still make six figures with his job, her pension and her social security)  Any time my mom needs help around the house, somebody to take care of the dogs, or literally anything else I’m there. (and it’s been that way most of my adult life)  Last night, my mom called me to ask if I could sit with one of her dogs this morning so she could take the other to the vet.  She usually tears the house up when she’s left alone and she didn’t want to crate her.  She called me about a half hour beforehand to say, I want you to ride along with me to the vet with both dogs, because of a particularly traumatic experience there a few days ago with a nasty dog. She was concerned that she wouldn’t be able to keep him in the backseat and didn’t want to put him in the back of the SUV.  I hit some traffic in town that added a couple minutes onto my drive, and got there at 11:19 instead of 11:15.  The first words out of her mouth were, “that wasn’t very helpful.”  I asked what she meant, and she told me, I told you you to be here at 11:15 and now the dogs are freaking out because one is in the car and one is inside. (also, I’m not sure if my mom has been on time for anything in her entire life.)  We leave, we get to the vet, he gets his blood drawn, and (thankfully) his numbers are normal.  My stepfather couldn’t go because of a doctors appointment, but then shows up at the vet about halfway through the appointment, implying that she just could’ve scheduled this literally any other time today.  We get back, I ask her where she’d like me to put the leashes, and she told me on the table, and that I could head out now.  I said, “well, I love you, momma.”  She says, “(name,) I ask for so little… I ask for so little.” and walks out without saying another word.  I know it would’ve been less stressful for her if I was on time, but I feel like I do more her than most adult children. Also, her saying that she asks for so little makes me feel taken advantage of, and not telling me she loved me back really hurt. AITA??"

Parker has a bio kid(3f) with his ex wife as well as ex-wife's other child(8m) that he raised as his own while he was with his ex-wife.   Parker is in the military and stationed in a different state. I love parkers kids and we visit them often when he is in town since I live close to his family. Works out well. He is happy with the kids he has (with reasonable partial custody) and does not want any more kids.  I do not have any kids myself and I do not plan on having any kids.  Early on in our dating relationship (and several times since) we discussed his kids and how I would be involved. I was clear on that I do not want to be a full time parent. I will not be a stay at home mom or change my entire life to take care of the kids. I want to be like a cool aunt. He expressed he did not expect or want that. We came to agree that I would be a mother like person in their life and Co-parent in most cases. But the kids are not my full responsibility and I am not their mother.  All of that is fine and dandy for us. But I have been getting comments and what not from others acting as if that is unreasonable and shitty of me to not totally accept parenting of kids I didn't have.  I have a busy work and social life that I am not willing to abandon that. I am willing to adjust some things to spend time with the kids and do things with them (as I already do). I will pick them up from school, take them to soccer, go to the park, get up in the middle of the night if they are sick, make food, ect. But I am not signing up for being fully responsible.  As a woman people already expect me to be maternal and take on responsibility that they would not expect in a man in my same situation. Parker agrees with me on all of this.  His mother has put a bit more responsibility on me than I would like but we addressed it without further issue.   His sister thinks I should take full responsibility for the kids and thinks I am an asshole for my stance. Parker supports me and my role and told her that.   Aita? Some parents who are friends view it as a red flag that I'm not all in. Others think it's reasonable to express boundaries and expectations and as long as we agree on it.  What does reddit think?

I’m not in school. My life right now pretty much consists of working, going to the gym, taking care of my pet rats, and whatever fandom I might be in in that moment. It’s hard to find things to talk about with my family members outside of that stuff. I never EVER talk to my family about fandom stuff or even what show I’m watching because when I was younger my interests were never taken seriously with family. I would be teased relentlessly for liking something “too much.” This has caused difficulties with relationships and friendships because I have such a hard time opening up about that stuff so I have a hard time finding others with common interests.   Recently, I’ve been trying to talk less about work and more about my interests (which is really hard for me) which right now consists of rats because of how much I’ve been bonding with them and researching them, but it’s been met with eye rolls or being told I’m “killing the conversation” or just them clearly not listening and just saying “oh yeah?” after I say something. It hurts and just reinforces the fact that I shouldn’t share my interests with others.  The other night at dinner, I was telling them about how my rat enjoys this blanket I knitted for them and I was met with the usual “oh yeahs” and it’s been a really hard week for me and I just snapped and said, “can’t you guys just pretend to be interested in my life for five minutes?”  Even when I talk about work, they don’t take much interest or I’m told I’m talking down to the guys who are affecting my job performance for not getting their jobs done or doing this or that wrong.

More specifically, his condition is at a point where he can walk a short distance but with crutches, so he is usually in a wheelchair. He does not have any cognitive, intellectual, or learning disabilities, so he attends regular public high school. The only accommodation he has is that all of his classes are on the first floor.   Unfortunately, kids can be cruel and heartless. My son learned the hard way. People belittle him in the hallways if he isn't moving fast enough in his wheelchair for them, and some call him derogatory names. He states that it's mostly other boys who do this and that the girls are a lot more mature and accepting.   Over the summer, I will sometimes take him to work with me. I work as a project supervisor for a residential subdivision. He got to see many of the same workers multiple times as I took him along with me to many homes I supervised. He took a liking to the plumbers, but I think that they're a bad influence on him. One in particular swears...A LOT...I mean he says ""fuck"" at least three times every sentence. Imagine a fat 40-year-old man with a mullet swearing incessantly on the phone in front of myself, my son, and the Mexicans he hires from Home Depot to assist him.  My son has picked up on the extreme swearing habits. His favorite word to use is ""motherfucker."" He's gotten quite a few referrals and even some detentions for using ""extreme profanity"" in front of a group of friends he met this school year. These friends of his don't tell the teachers, rather they often overhear him. Under normal circumstances, I would severely punish any child of mine for this. However, because he is b bullied often due to having cerebral palsy, I basically let it slide. People think that since he has cerebral palsy that it automatically also means he is mentally challenged. This is certainly not the case with my son. The bullying has actually gone down this year compared to the past two ever since he started ""talking blue."" That being said, I have discussed with him that he is not to direct his profanity at any teacher, staff member, or female. He understand this boundary and only swears in front of his ""clique"" of all-male friends.  Sometimes, he talks to his friends on his phone at home, and the swearing is very audible. As mentioned earlier, I don't punish him for his multiple detentions earned for profanity, but my wife and my daughter can't stand it. My daughter says that it's gross even though she understands why I let him get away with it (note: he never swears at his sister or his mother, or directly at me)."

We haven't been official for very long but we had a long dating phase and have been friends for 4 years, so our relationship moved quickly. My parents welcomed her with open arms and have been very kind to let her stay here with us.  The car I'm driving is NOT mine. It is my dad's, he bought for work but has been working from home. I've been fortunate that he allows me to use it for school/ leisure, he pays for gas and insurance.  She started an internship this week. I live in the suburbs, but I go to uni in the same city as the internship. Her internship is in downtown. She needs to be there at 8am, with rush hour and distance it can easily take 50-60 minutes or even more if an accident.  The metro is closer to my house than the internship, \~20 min. We've been waking up at 6 am to get ready and take her to the station. We missed her train on Wednesday because we got out of bed late. So I had to drive her to her internship. The drive there was horrible and very annoying. It took nearly two hours to and from my house!  I made her breakfast and got her lunch ready for today. I came back to my room and she asked me if I could just take her to her internship, and that I could say no. So I said no because the drive is horrible and uses lots of gas.  I considered going to the internship but the route was \~55 mins, so I kept driving to the station. We got there and I said ""I love you, have a good day at work"". She says nothing, grabs her things, and slams the door and walks away. I am flabbergasted, upset and annoyed that she did that. She usually texts me when the train leaves, but didn't. I waited a bit to see the train leave, but couldn't see. After about 10 minutes I left.  She sent a barrage of texts saying she was hurt and it doesn't take much to sit and drive. Also sent ""idk if I want to be with you if you're not willing to do this for me"" , etc.   Note: She started working a a grocery store this past fall to help keep busy and make money. I would take her to and from because it was near the uni we went to. I would even take her to work on the days I didn't have school or class. So this idea that I'm not willing to help is just not true. I am just not trying to burn a hole in my dads pocket for gas.  I am furious at this point, I have done so much for her these past 6 months! How could she be saying all these things to me? That I don't help her and she doesn't know if she can do this. I reply calmy to her ""I don't want to talk right now. I won't have a clear head or good things to say."" She responds "" Neither do I. But I at least want to know that you're okay"". I say back to her ""I am. I'm home. Thanks for caring.""  I feel she's being a bit ungrateful and selfish. We've talked a bit, but haven't made progress towards making up. She says I'm not seeing her perspective, but I also feel she's not seeing mine.   AITA?"

When the waiter came I told him for just a few glasses of water, nothing else, and my friend interjected and asked for a beer, I stoped the waiter and told him no, just water.

His parents are cery old for his age, both 60+, with the father being close to a house plant due to being an extreme inteovert and parkinsons. Mother has to do everything in the house except cook on Fridays. She is well over her breaking point and wants my friend to move out.  They have been teying to make it work at home but they can never get into an agreement for the chores. Everyday he gets home and gets yelled at for 30minutes. He had to sleep over 5 times these last 3 months because he got kicked out and was told not to come back. Everybody acts like nothing happened the next day because the mother feels bad for having to kick out her son and he doesn't want to put in the effort to move out.  Admittedly losing this room would also be a big loss for our friend group. It's central amd we study and chill here about every day. We talked moving out a couple of times and came to the conclusion that it would be feasible and better for him, but he'd still eather spent his time and money on living the easy life.  Problem is that neither him or his family live an easy life right now. I truly feel bad for his mother that she has to burden her husband, his little brother and the house while no longer being fit enough to do all that. Meanwhile my friend fails to get morivated due to constant arguing resulting in him doing even less chores and homework.  I was thinking of suggesting to the mom that she COULD (if she really wanted to) throw him out right now. My room has a special agreement with the government making it only 350 euro's, making it one of the cheapest and biggest students rooms in the city. I'm pretty sure knowing this she would kick him out, but it would be on me for enabling her.   I have had people tell me it is none of my business, but I disagree. I am friends with both the family and my friend and I want the best for them. Plus everytime he gets kicked out he has to stay over at my house, which is becoming more then a monthly event. It's safe to assume if he really gets kicked out he will have to live in my place as well sonce I am the only one who can and will accomodate him.  I wan't to emphasize I would be an asshole to me friend, but I do think it wi help the family.  So WIBTA for suggesting to my friends mom to kick him out while there is a room available?"

One of my friends in our apartment building had a bong, and he asked if we could borrow it. While taking rips, he dropped the bowl somehow, and it broke into a few pieces. I immediately told my friend and he promised to replace it. He didn't have the funds right then and there, plus my allowance was a couple of days away. I told her personally that if he didn't replace it, then I would do it with my allowance. She was pretty annoyed by it (justified), but she accepted the answer.   As the week went by, I noticed a few items from my home randomly going missing (bags of chips, shirts, a couple of pairs of stretch pants, snacks). I didn't put too much thought into it, I figured that I had just misplaced these items or eaten them and forgot about it. That same weekend, I was at the friend's apartment, and she left me alone in there to go meet up with another tenant for an exchange. I was looking around and noticed her laundry basket was overflowed. As I stared at the clothes, i noticed a distinctive pair of stretch pants that my mother had purchased for me from a boutique at home. I quickly rummaged through the apartment and found one of my shirts and the variety bag of chips I had from my apartment (they were ripped open a certain way, so I remembered).  I was beyond angry. I had given her a key to my apartment, so I would always have someone who could let me in if I got locked out. (A previous incident happened where my abusive ex literally locked me out for the night and I had to sleep on someone's floor until he would let me in.) I thought I could trust this friend with a key to my ""home"" but she had been using it to steal from me ever since my boyfriend broke her bong. I left her place after she returned and just stopped hanging out with her and didn't speak to her, I never replaced the piece of bong that was broken. AITA?  P.S. Karma did hit her a little when she left her door unlocked, and other neighbors went in and stole her laptop with all of her textbooks and assignments on it."

In early July of ‘21, John had fallen and fractured his hip and was hospitalized until the beginning of September when he was moved to rehab. With John unwell, my dad’s arrangements fell to me. Jane never offered to handle it, she just told me that she would help me with whatever I needed but, she couldn’t travel to Vegas. John took his brother’s passing hard as the rehab facility was constantly contacting me about the lack of progress he was making. About the middle of Oct., he had run out of coverage for rehab and was unable to care for himself. The plan was to get him from Vegas and bring him back to our home with my mom and I. With his weakness, it was going to require 2 people. I updated Jane about John and before ever asking for anything she just said she would help me with anything but, she couldn’t go to Vegas. I had to have my fiancé’s sister fly 8 hours on a Saturday to Vegas and fly 8 hours back that same night. The following weekend, I had to fly back out to Vegas alone to pick-up my dads ashes and collect anything important from their house and clean what I could. John’s care was too much for me and my mom so, he had to be moved into a nursing facility. I spent time nearly every other day speaking to attorneys, case managers, doctors, etc. for John. The attorney advised me that he needed the equity from his Vegas home for his care. The realtor estimated it would sell for X(due to lack of care, damage, mess, etc). If I was willing, they could have their team do some work to bring the potential sale price to 1.5-2X. I spoke nearly every other day to their team for a month for the renovations. I entered a contract for a little over 2X Jan. 22’ and days later, John passed away.   I am the executor handling probate and Jane has done nothing. There was a 401k and I provided Jane the info to make her claim. After I saw the medical debt John accrued, I asked to Jane for the whole 401k to cover any expenses I was incurring as it looked like the estate could go bankrupt. She agreed but, had not made the claim. This went on for ~month when I finally had the attorney draw up a paper having Jane forfeit her claim to the 401k. The 401k contact called me to say after 3 months of not hearing back from Jane, she finally had. The contact did not know however, that her call came ~hour after I emailed Jane the 401k forfeit form. Just to be clear, it ONLY applied to the 401k. Jane never brought the 401k money up to me again and neither did I. Months past and working with the attorney, taking the harder paths, we settled most of John’s debt for much less than anticipated. This resulted in more than expected(~a decent one-time annual salary in the US) that will be inherited. John’s will, written 6 years earlier, spelled out 50:50 for Jane and I. He verbally talked with me in the months before passing about revisiting that but, I never deemed him well enough to sign a new will."

The other night she added a few new things, I assume it was to make the apartment more homey as we are still adding decor and furniture. But in my opinion it these new decorations looked very out of place. My other roommate (19m) asked about the new decorations and I said Beth had put them up while we were at work and that I don’t like them. I asked if maybe I was thinking too hard about it and he agreed it doesn’t look good.

Fast forward to last night, I’m with my roommate (19m) and his little sister. She asked about the decorations and said “what IS that?” and I said that Beth had put them up. I asked her if they look tacky and she too agreed. I added that “it just doesn’t look right in a modern apartment” and told her my plan to replace them. My other roommate added that looks “like a crack house now”. I don’t think that should’ve been said.     Well Beth heard and came out pissed off and took down one of the decorations. I told her exactly what I had just told my other roommates sister. That it doesn’t look right in this type of apartment. She just gave a defeated “yeah” and went back to her room. I feel bad but was told I shouldn’t because of all the things she pulled.   For context to that Beth is problematic. Short on rent, doesn’t contribute often to groceries, doesn’t take responsibility for her cat tearing up things, damaged my car when I let her borrow it and didn’t own up to it until I said something. Prone to guilt tripping, she’s the type to spin any story into how she can do no wrong. I quite literally had to stop her from hooking up with a junior in highschool.

We were having a lot of arguments with the landlord. Wifi and some other services were on my name and we would split the bill. When the tenancy ended, everyone moved to a different house and none of them paid me the bill. I was doing an unpaid internship and paying medical bills as I had been sick for months. I informed them multiple times to pay last month's bill but they ignored. I didn't had money to pay on their behalf so I got fined and had to pay $400.  Fast forward to now we had an LTB hearing this month. Landlord was asking for $8500 in damages and improper notice. He had provided 40-45 evidences none of which included my name. Yet other's were repeatedly mentioned in those. Like the damages they caused in their own rooms and kitchen. I was the only one who gave a proper notice. But since it was a joint lease In fact I was the only who was able to provide evidences for the hearing. None of them put any effort. We were given an option if we want to settle. So we settled at $1200. One of the guy agreed to pay the $1200. LTB said they don't care who pays the money, landlord just wants the money. That's it. Case closed.  Now when that guy asked me money, I told him that he owed me too. He said that we can settle what he owes me later on. I said no, we won't. He won't get the full amount. I asked him all of them ignored my messages? They tried to laugh it away. This pissed me off so much. Since then he has been asking me for money and I'm ignoring his messages. In fact I don't want to pay anything because why the hell was I even dragged in all this?  I had warned them several times of the consequence and they acted tough year back saying that they will fight during the hearing. If I pay him it means I'm paying for his damages? It's not about money. It's about the accountability they never took and I was dragged with it. What should I do? WIBTA for not giving him money."

I have already failed this class once and this is my last chance. I have been there for over a month and a half only 2-3 days a week. One girl there keeps flipping out that no matter what I do I still make mistakes. She has gotten to the point of yelling from the other room about me, telling everyone ‘I am not dealing with her, she can’t do xyz right, you go tell her so and so has tried’. I is exhausting. She yells from the other room so I can hear and idk how much more I can take. Now I normally learn pretty quickly, and yes I did make mistakes, that tends to happen when you’re so busy no one shows you how things are properly done the first time. I am open to constructive criticism however, when you are yelling so loud that everyone in the office can hear it is getting into harassment territory. I have kept quiet about so much harassment in my life and it has broken me in the past several times over. I just cannot do it again. I have expressed my feelings to other workers and have been told to ‘suck it up, you wont be here long anyway’. Thing is, one of the girls wants me to stay. I just cannot deal with this anymore. I am in my final class and am a month away from finishing but to be honest I want to quit. I know if I do the consequences my family will dole out will be worse. I need to have a meeting with the office head when he gets back from vacation in a couple of days concerning scheduling purposes. My only office friend is willing to go with me to talk to him about it. My school offers surveys regarding our experiences and I don’t want to give a bad review because the others are really great and it is only one person, but there will be 2 more students staring in a few weeks and they do not deserve the same treatment. I want to talk to the higher ups but should I go to my school too? WIBTA if I tell my school what is going on since I am there for a learning experience and am not compensated for time? It would be different if I had a choice I guess but I cannot take this High-school attitude if mob mentality anymore but I need to graduate. I need advice, has anyone dealt with this?"

For a little more context every year we've been dating we have celebrated Valentine's Day on some level, usually I take her to a fancy dinner etc, even during covid I cooked her a nice meal with homemade chocolate strawberries etc.  Fast forward to a week ago and my fiance came to me and asked if I had a problem with her hanging out with a friend on February 14thIt was late and she was tired after work so we never really decided one way or the other.  Cut to last night where she asked again if it was ok for her to go and when she told me the dates again it clicked for me that she was talking about leaving on Valentine's Day. I confirmed that she knew that it was Valentine's Day because maybe she forgot like I did and she said it's not like Valentine's day is a big holiday and it really doesn't matter because we can celebrate it later anyways.  This upset me from my point of view, she is choosing to hang out with a friend who again, she has literally never even hung out with before over spending and anniversary and Valentine's Day with her fiance.   I went quiet after she was done, and even though we were about to go to bed excused myself from the room and slept on the couch Now this morning we've discussed it again and I tried to explain why I left.  Convo Her : We can celebrate whenever and it's her 21st birthday so she's excited.  Me : By that logic you could celebrate her 21st birthday with her whenever... ( Implying she can miss the vineyard and still celebrate with her on the weekend or something )  Her : Well it's her birthday and she wants to do it the 14th.  Me : Well if she insists on having her party on Valentine's day she can't be upset if couples want to spend the day together instead of going, she should pick a different day or at least invite both sides of the couple ( not sure if I mentioned but at no point was I told I was invited to come along even though it's a group thing and the friends boyfriend will be there )  Her : Do you not hear how selfish that sounds that you want her to not celebrate her birthday when she wants to!?  Me : She can have her party wherever she wants, but if she's inviting other people on Valentine's day there's a good chance any couple will have plans or at least want to come together!  I then tried to ask how she would feel if I didn't celebrate her birthday this year to go hangout with a new person I've never hung out with before, and we'd just ""celebrate later""  Her : That's different it's my birthday   Sorry for the long post but PLEASE weigh in here, AITA here?  TLDR : My fiance thinks I'm selfish for wanting to spend Valentine's day (also an anniversary) together instead of her celebrating a ( BRAND NEW ) friends birthday that I wasn't invited to."

Before I moved in with him, I noticed that he paid lots of attention to his belongings. For instance, he told me not to push the window of his car door to close it but the handle and do not touch his computer monitor with my fingers. I did exactly what he told me because I thought they were his stuff and he had the right to do so. But since we've lived together, the list just went on and on. I can't crush garlic with the blade of the knife because it may loosen the blade one day. I can't stand side way and close the blind because I may damage it somehow. I can't put any hot objects such as pots and lids on the kitchen counter or the sink because I may leave some kind of irreparable marks. I can't not put my tiny (3"") flower pots on the window because it may scrach it. He's always busy with his work so I'm the only one doing the cooking and cleaning. I always follow what he said because it is his house and I respect him. But sometimes, doing the work around the house and listening to his complains all together is too much. I got enough today so I told him that I don't think most of these things will actually do what he think they will. And if they would, I don't think it's a big deal either. He gave me a whole long speech of how these things will eventually damage his house and devalue it. I don't know what to do anymore. I know we love each other verry much, but it feels suffocating sometimes. Am I wrong? Please help!"

We were close coworkers for 6 years, then for the past almost year I have relocated across the country for my spouses job. Joseph, another friend, and I have a text chat for random life stuff and memes that we use every couple of days.  Joseph told us yesterday that he is suspended and possibly fired (decision pending) for sexual harassment. He has been sending sexual/inappropriate memes to at least one female coworker and he showed an example. He said people are overly sensitive and it’s funny, and he’s pissed that they went to HR instead of talking to him.  I’ve tried explaining that harassment isn’t just direct propositioning, or showing nudes. This meme could easily be seen as propositioning too, especially to a coworker if you send it to them individually. He at most has said it probably wasn’t good to send to them but he still acts like this is being done to him unfairly.  I am fed up. This isn't the first time he’s crossed the line (he showed me a pic of his friend in a bra one time and I flipped out saying he had better learn from this and delete it or I will tell her. I didn’t report because I was moving and wanted to give him a chance to change. Clearly not.)  I don’t want him to lose his job but I think this might be the only way to show him. As a last ditch effort I gave him a prompt, almost thinking/writing homework about what this meme would have meant for the other person, and what he learned from the experience.  I am now an educational assistant in elementary and this is not unlike a writing prompt we give 3rd graders. I would never otherwise send an adult something so condescending but I am not ok with his behavior and he is going through life refusing to grow or make long term change.  I don’t know if I can be good friends with someone who treats women this way, or who I can’t trust to have my guard down.  AITA?"

I called her out and said maybe I could understand that if she was ordering beer but she always orders margaritas or fancy cocktails.  I tried to explain to her why you should  tip your bartender, but she didn’t want to hear it. There was a lot of back and forth about this but she’s not changing her mind.

I do know how to dress in slacks and button-ups when the occasion calls for it like having to do the rare meeting at work, weddings, nice restaurants, stuff like that so I own just a couple of nice things. I've been with my girlfriend for little over a year now. I love this woman just how she is and couldn't care less if she's in sweats and baggy shirt, she's still hot to me. A while back she showed up at my place with shopping bags and said that she had a surprise for me. Bags were full of new clothes that are completely opposite from who and what I am. I told her thanks but she should really take them and get her money back because I would hardly ever wear them. She said they were a gift and I could find plenty of reasons to wear them.   Bags have been sitting in my closet close to a month now. This last time she was at my house she saw them still in the closet and got upset that I haven't worn them and asked if I'd start wearing them for her. I told her I'd wear them for appropriate occasions but random everyday wear that she wanted, no, there's no reason for me to get home from a day of work all dirty and get into slacks and a blazer. She suggested that we start going to really nice restaurants for our weekly date night so I'd have reason to wear them, I told her only if she starts pitching in to pay for our dates. Then she hit me with how her ex would dress that way often for her so I told her she had three options: go make-up with her ex and get back with him, I get to change 50% of her wardrobe to stuff I like and she wears it for me, or we just drop the entire topic and she takes the clothes back, and makes due with seeing me dressed like that once a month when I take her someplace really nice and any other special occasions that pop up.  She dropped it but is still pouting days later. My take is that I would never just take it upon myself to buy her a bunch of clothes in a style I know she hates and expect her to wear it half the time just for me, or insist she starts wearing make-up just because I like it, so I didn't think I was wrong to refuse to wear them.

Unfortunately my Momo passed away a in October and we've both been feeling the loss.   Recently, the loneliness and lack of companionship was starting to get to me so with the advice of my therapist I adopted a new dog for the purpose of it becoming an ESA.

She got mad at me. She told me that it wasn't her fault that he liked her better, that pets choose their owners not the other way around. That if he wanted to be with her, then that was that, she wasn't going to deny him the ""pleasure"" of sleeping with her (her words). She even went on to say that if he chose her as his mom then I couldn't stop him from being with her because that was animal abuse and implied that she'd take him if I were to ever move out  So, I moved all of his things into my room (even took the treats and toys she’d taken from the kitchen into her room) and shut the door at night. Only to wake up and find out that she had taken him from my room again. I woke her up by calling him for his walk and she freaked. She said I was inconsiderate for her need of companionship and that if my last dog as allowed to sleep in her room then so should this one.

Bf- 1 cat  John- 1 dog Taylor- 2 cats  My dog is well trained and has only had issues with one big dog that kept stepping on her before she went through service dog training and never had issues with cats. She gets along well with my boyfriend's cat they even cuddle at night and if that cat is around he will defend her from the other cat.   One of Taylor's cats immediately didn't like her and started going after her. She has gotten numerous scratches from his cat and his cat has never been harmed. I've tried playing with his cat to get his energy out, I've pet them both at the same time so he associates her with me petting him. I thought it was getting better until today. It was totally fine they sniffed each other this morning and whenever I see them interacting I keep a close eye on it.   Then, I got up to grab something from the kitchen and she stayed on the couch and he went after her. I grabbed her and picked her up and brought her to the kitchen and cleaned her up because she was bleeding. I pet her and gave her lots of love and then went and pet him to try and pacify him. I was upset, but I understand it's a process. Like an hour later she jumped down towards the water bowl and he went after her again and I pulled her back onto the couch and his other cat came running in and attacked her while I was holding her so I got scratched too.   The cats continued hissing at her and prowling and I threw a pillow in their direction to get them to back off a bit. Then, I told her to stay (which she did) and put them in Taylor's room and let my boyfriend's cat out (my boyfriend's cat can't free feed and Taylor free feeds his cats and gets mad when my boyfriend's cat is out when his door is open)   Taylor then got mad at me for putting his cats in his room because he pays rent here when I don't (not even always true- he has needed help with rent 3 times in 9 months and he has the master room with a private bath. I also do more chores than he does even though I don't live here).   We spend more time here because it's closer to my boyfriend's work and my school than my apartment is. I honestly am feeling bad about my dog and her being in this situation. I hoped I could figure it out, but idk if that's the case anymore.

The kitten lived at my apartment, and I paid the vet bills and most of his food/litter. I am a bit of a doormat and tend to go along with things because I don’t like to rock the boat. Well, they kind of staked a claim to the cat, despite him living with me, and got me to agree to let them take care of him if we were to break up. I now regret agreeing to that, but I was willing to let them take the cat because of that agreement.   Well, due to their living situation, income, and mom (she didn’t like the cat) they can no longer keep the cat, but they won’t return him to me. Instead, they plan to give the cat to their mom’s co-worker. I got pretty upset when they texted me this because they made it out as if I had no say in the situation. When I asked to have him back, they started talking about how neither of us is capable of taking care of a cat, and he needs a stable home with owners who have enough money and time to care for him. Yes, a cat does need those things but I am fully capable of providing them. I have already had several pets that were solely my responsibility, I am in college and working part-time, and I really really love that cat. I guess not being home very much could be a bad thing, but many cat owners have full-time jobs, and that isn’t seen as neglect. I always make sure he has stuff to do while I’m gone and make up for it by giving him extra attention when I am home.   We have been arguing over text for a few days now, but they started ignoring me, and I am afraid they will just give him away anyways. I texted their mom hoping she would talk to ex or give me the cat since he is staying with her at the moment, but she just said to handle it with ex. But I can’t because they are ignoring me. They were pissed that I texted their mom, but I don’t know what else to do because they are just opening my messages, and this is time sensitive.   My friends are all on my side and have suggested going to the police and getting him back that way, but I feel very guilty, and they are saying I'm the asshole because I said they could have the cat, but I said they could take care him, not give him away. Are there any other ways I can get my cat back, and if not, would I be the asshole for taking it to the police if their mom won’t help me?"

We talked about our relationship and we had already been friends for so long we weren’t worried. So anyways the pregnancy goes great we have a wonderful baby. However after baby was born I struggled heavily with Post partum depression. I went to therapy and was getting on the proper meds to handle it and I was open and honest with my partner about how my depression isn’t his fault and I’m working on getting better. However because I was struggling my libido was next to nothing so we had very sporadic sex. He prefers to have sex everyday but at this time in my life it was difficult. Anyways A few month ago our kid is now one, I find out he’s been cheating. He wants to make it work and his reasoning for cheating was that I wasn’t loving him enough during that 7 month period. I think that’s bullshit and he continuing to make me feel as though it’s my fault. So AITA ? should I have been more loving ?"

Of course I didn't remove them because it's not against any rules, so I kept them there, that pissed him off and he told me to remove them again but I didn't and since then we have had a strained relationship.  A few days ago my husband (30M) picked up our older daughters early from school and dropped them off at my office, and just to clarify, my boss knows that he does that from time to time when their babysitter has to do something else and she doesn't have a problem with it, in fact, she has told me many times that she likes them to go because they love to help. But my coworker hated it, he said next time they go there talk to HR and hopefully they'll kick me out because I'm unprofessional. I told him to do it, that I didn't care, and before he did I talked to them and since my boss agrees and other colleagues didn't complain about them, they told me that there's no problem because they usually only go there for 30 minutes or sometimes even less time.   My husband kept taking them to work and this morning my coworker confronted me furiously because he told me that I'm an asshole that I need to understand that he hates children, that it is his work space too and that I must respect it. But I am not going to stop doing it because I know that my daughters do not bother anyone, they do not even talk to him and they are not even in our office because sometimes they are helping the woman who cleans to pick up the coffee cups etc. So AITA for continuing to do that?"

She has been wanting to do this for a while now and my room is one of the best deals you can get in my city. The problem is that my friend is very irresponsible and really doesn't want to move out, so I would be backstabbing him in his eyes despite my good intentions.  Lets start with some background. My friend currently has a very bad relationship with his parents. Mother says he doesn't do enough but he says she complains before he even gets the chance to do it. He had to stay the night 5 times these last 3 months since his mother got so angry she threw him out of the house, only to pretend like nothing happened the day after.  Said friend refuses to even send an email to let my landlord know he is interested, despite having gone on and off on wanting the room these last 2 months. He says it is too expensive (despite literually not having to work and still being able to afford the rent + health care from his government allowance) and he would rather safe up for a car and spend money on fun things while he still can. Additionually he is using me as a bad example saying he doesn't want to live in a mess and financial insecurity when he can just live at home. All valid points except that I choose to live like this. It has nothing to do with the room and everyone who has lived in this house has always been able to follow school, pay rent and do fun stuff.  i carefully talked over all the specifics with him. He agrees with me he could pay for the room, but he doesn't trust himself enough to take care of himself and his study in the meantime. Since losing the room would also be a big loss for the friend groups smoking/learning sessions, I offered him to pay 100 euros a month for him taking the room and I offered to help force him to do his homework like they did with me. He still chooses to stay with his parents since it is cheaper and more comfortable.  Long story short, I genuinly believe moving out will be better for the family and my friend, but he won't see it that way. Would I be the asshole if I asked his mom to kick him out?"

My fiance (30m) and I (30f) attended his cousin's (24f) wedding 5 months ago. She is not anywhere near as well-off as we are, and although we certainly aren't what I would call wealthy, we did decide to go a little bit extra on their wedding gift since we could and felt like she and her fiance could use the help. Nothing crazy, but about $100 more than we usually do. We figured it would be appreciated and for us, it was just skipping a few take-out meals and cooking at home, not going to break the bank.     Well, we got her thank you card today. Honestly, we both had kind of forgot about it and were pleasantly surprised to get the card, figuring better late than never. The card was a very impersonal, to quote: ""Dear family and friends, Thank you for the kind gift! We appreciate it and treasure your love and support! Love, Cousin and Husband."" They didn't even write our names anywhere or even sign it. It was clearly a generic card that they mass printed. We were both a little bothered by it.   &amp;#x200B;  Here's where we may be the AHs: we went out to dinner with my fiance's parents and started talking about our own wedding, how I had found some pretty invitation sets at a great deal where they throw in thank you cards for free. My fiance made a comment about how ""we could just have them print up a form message like cousin did."" Well, his parents went OFF on us. That we didn't understand how hard it was to be poor and struggling, and that giving her a nice gift didn't entitle us to undying gratitude. I said that it had nothing to do with the money - if she had sent us a nice text message or even a piece of paper that at least had our names on it and referenced the gift, I would have been happy. However, damage is done, and now his immediate family thinks that we are snobs. I wasn't going to say anything about this to anyone, but I also don't think my fiance is totally wrong for mentioning it to his parents, who he should be able to vent to, but AI (we)TA?"

Me and my ex 27m were together for 3 1/2 years and planning to move in together the following year. I thought I got my period in September but thought it was shorter and lighter than usual but put that up to me stopping taking birth control.  So I continued to drink and got a tattoo. Only I felt off the day after my tattoo. I remembered the question on my tattoo form asking if you could be pregnant. So just in case I took a test.   It was positive, I felt scared but I was so happy. I've always want to be a mother and had talked with my ex about wanting to have kids. The thing is he wasn't sure if you could have them. Medical problems when younger and was scared to know if he couldn't.  I took another test the one it tells you how many weeks and from what I remember about our private life. I was at least 4 to 6 weeks along at the time.  When I found out I didn't want to phone or text him about it. So I waiting for the next time I was going to see him. A week later he texted me to come over after work. I thought it was weird as if we met during the week its in town not at home.  When I opened the door for he to come in he said ""I want to go back to being friends"" before I could think I said ""Well good thing am not pregnant"" After some talk he left and I cried the hardest I have ever in my life. Sadly that Friday night I started to cramp and I lost the baby in the week.   He's now moved on with someone we know and it kills me. But he should know that kids are an option someday."

Im also on SW. I have to be constantly checked on even though I've repeatedly said i wouldnt do anything again. My caretaker is also around 7 months pregnant now. Which I understand means she's not in the best shape herself.  For awhile I've been feeling a bit unsafe with my caretaker, like she just doesnt care about me. There are multiple reasons, but 2 situations I feel I can share.  The first was around 2 weeks ago now. My ear was really hurting, so I texted my caretaker before going to the sink. My ear felt wet so I folded a tissue and just put it in my ear. When I removed it, it was covered in blood. I panicked and immediately told my caretaker before checking my ear again. With a mirror I could see a cut and a bit of something sticking in my ear. I was able to pull it out, it was a piece of plastic, and I decided to treat the cut in my ear. I heard my caretaker walking around outside my room and I thought she was finally coming to check on me and make sure I was okay. But she didn't. It took me around 10 minutes to treat my ear and she never came in. I went out of my room to see her and she was standing less than a foot away from my door looking at her phone. I said hi and she said hi, then she just went back to the couch.  I ended up telling my mother (she pays the caretaker) and she was so mad that she docked her pay for awhile.   The second situation has become more of a normal occurrence. My dad leaves at around 7 am and my caretaker gets here at 7:30. I get medication at 6 am, and then every 6 hours to help with the pain.  Since there are a few sketchy people who've been seen around, I've started double locking the doors, meaning for anyone to get inside I'd have to unlock the door first.  Recently, when my dad goes to work, my caretaker hasn't been coming over. She's stayed home, which means that I miss my 12 pm meditation and don't get any medication until around 1:30 or 2 pm when my dad gets home (My parents, my doctors, and my caretaker have all made it clear I'm not to take medication myself and I must have someone there with me). I once again told my mother about this and she's now looking into finding me a new caretaker.   When they hired her, my parents had a contract with her that said a few things as well as they would prefer she not get pregnant while working for them and that if she did she would be replaced. My mother wasn't made away of the pregnancy until my caretaker was around 4-5 months pregnant simply because my dad doesn't want to go through the process of finding a replacement.  I see my caretakers POV. Pregnancy hasn't been easy on her, I don't blame her for anything. I wasn't trying to get her wages docked.    AITA?"

They way he is with his grandchildren and daughters are a fundamental part of why i got involved with him to begin with.   One of his Daughters S(29) has said and done a few things that have made me uncomfortable, in that they kind of remind me of my own past experiences. (i.e. ""we aren't friends any more dad because you have a girl friend"", Yelling and hanging up on him because he didn't bring her a plate of a meal she'd declined the previous day,""You owe me xy and z because i'm your kid and i am still breathing"" ""She (meaning me) is having second thoughts cuz you're (A was dressing up as santa) so old"" etc ).

A was on facetime with S and was asking about her plans for the evening, especially as she was borrowing his car at the time. She was getting annoyed at the questions and said ""Why don't you ask your girlfriend what her plans are, Dad?""   I replied from the next room ""I'm helping watch your son and doing laundry. Thanks for asking."" In part because i don't want to be dragged into what ever is going with them.   She responded with ""That was a personalized attack. Nice Girlfriend, Dad."" and hung up on him. I asked him if i was out of line or offensive and he's just as confused as i am. He drove over there and she just says ""I'm over it.""

We've been together since October, so almost four months. He's told me from the beginning that I can tell him anything that's bothering me to him and we'll figure it out together. The thing is, he doesn't really know how to express himself emotionally. So, whenever I'm upset about something I just try not to talk about it because I genuinely don't know if it will upset him or not, because he never tells me if/when he is upset with me or about a situation.  Last night I was just feeling very upset because I had just had a rough day, and I was feeling like in the past few days that he had been withdrawn and not really involved in the conversations we were having. So, after my friend had left my place I decided to call him to just talk to him and see if I was just being overly emotional and irritable. Well, when he answered it was almost like nothing. Just a simple Hi, which from different perspectives is normal, but at that moment all I wanted to hear was a ""hey baby how are you?"" which is our usual banter. We're on the phone for about an hour with small talk about valentines day plans, and seeing my best friend but that was it. I make a lot of our conversation, so whenever I'm upset or whatever the conversation is very little to nothing at all, just silence.  He then asks what's bothering me after I get ready for bed after being on the phone for an hour. I know what's going on and why I'm upset but I'm not sure how to form it into words. So, I stumble with my words for a little bit, when I finally tell him that I fell like over the past few days I have felt that he was not super present and that there has been not really any affection as well. After I said that I hear a ""I knew there was something wrong, I have been trying to figure it out all day. You were being so short."" He never asked if everything was okay, I'm also a college student who takes intense classes. After he said that I knew he was upset, and I immediately felt horrible. After a few more minutes on the phone, he asks if it's cool if he goes to bed, I say yes and that I love him and he says he loves me to, and then hangs up. its currently 11:19am and I haven't heard from him all day, and has off of work today as well. I'm just worried. So, AITA?"

The last time I was in the apartment it was not there, so it was very clearly either him or a friend he had over. He seemed to find it quite funny and when I commented that I hope the cost of repairs won't come out of our deposit, he said it definitely would. My concern now is that when we get our deposit back at the end of our tenancy, money will be deducted from both of our shares of the deposit (one month's rent) equally despite the damage not being in anyway my fault.

I love her, she is a brilliant and beautiful woman, but she needs to control everything or she will loose her absolute mind.  We are an interfaith couple—I’m Jewish and he is Catholic—and our religious identities are important to our identities. I suggested we have a private courthouse wedding and then a big reception to keep everyone happy, or at least equally disappointed. My mom really wants a big ceremony though, and she wants our family’s rabbi to officiate.   If we are having a religious ceremony then it is important for my fiancé and his family to at least have some catholic elements in it—a benediction and a reading, which I think would be great and express us as a couple! The problem is my mom has put her foot down and said we can do an interfaith wedding but in the Christian aspects cannot say the word Jesus once or she will be deeply offended.  I think it’s wild to be offended by the name Jesus. I tried to tell her this on a call and she got super defensive and has been talking shit to the rest of my family. Am I the asshole for standing my ground and telling her that an interfaith wedding has to actually be interfaith? How do I appease her and not offend my partner and his family?

So when me and my GF started seeing each other we would spend night and day together as we were both unemployed at the time it was nice to be around her all the time and it still is. I LOVE watching movies and shows with her, playing pokemon GO, and going on cute dates. As of i want to October she has been very lacking in everything she knows i love to do with her. I ask her to watch a show with me, no she doesn't have the energy. I ask her if she wants to play games with me, no don't want to. I even try to initiate *pillow* time with her and get shut down. The main reason im getting so upset by this behavior is because when we started seeing each other she was all about doing things together but now if it's not something she wants to do; example. Watch TikToks for hours or cuddle and do nothing else. I get that she enjoys spending 3-4 hours on social media but i do not, so much so i even deleted my socials cause i used them mostly for NSFW content or very close to NSFW content and it made her feel insecure seeing the content in my FYP on TikTok or my feed on instagram. So instead of spending 400hrs trying to fix my algorithm i just got rid of them cause they were not important to me. But what is important to me and something i love to do is game. But she hates me gaming, she knew i was a gamer getting into the relationship and she acts all upset when i choose to sit and game for 3-4+ hours a day after i get off work to play games and unwind. Like i don't get visibly upset when she is on her phone doing what she chooses to do after work so why does she feel like she can do that to me? I even get off my games when she gets home from work dropping everything i'm doing to spend time with her just for her to glue to her phone after a couple of minutes so i end up just sitting there on the bed or couch doing nothing... Well today i kind of snapped and told her how i feel. That i feel seggz starved, like she wants me to spend all my time with her even if it means me being bored in the process, that its not fair that i feel uncomfortable enjoying my hobbies and interests in my own room in the house ive been living in for 5 years. All i get in return is ""i feel stressed and just am not in the mood for *pillow* as much as you"" but like what about the other things? Making me feel uncomfortable, making me feel guilty for doing things i love and enjoy, for even getting aroused in bed i feel guilty and uncomfortable. Its not fair to me imo and im thinking about getting rid of my pc and my switch cause i love her and dont want to give her reason to be upset with me but at the same time id be so bored all the time with nothing to do."

He describes his mom as one of the biggest abusers in his life, she’s misogynistic and very cold and *allowed* him to be abused by the men she dated.   The first time I was introduced to her (as her son’s gf) she completely ignored me and made it a point to make me feel awkward in a small group. On top of that I lie to her about my job (my bf knows this) for personal safety reasons.  The idea of this dinner has been sending me into full blown anxiety attacks because I feel like she is going to hound me on my job and make me feel like garbage. This will be the second time meeting her and I have been dating him for 7 months now. He has been around my mom and dad 10+ times and is always welcome at our holidays.

We are struggling a bit financially. He has known said coworker since HS (we are now all in our 30s) and I think it's safe to say that they are fairly close (they don't hang out or anything but they talk every day). At that point the coworker said ""don't worry about paying me back with money, you can just take me to and from places I need to go until we are squared away."" My husband accepted this offer.  Since he loaned my husband the money, my husband has carted him around easily 8 times. He has exceeded the $40 that he gave him and he just keeps calling and asking for rides. Well, now my husband's truck is spent and he has been using my vehicle to get to and from work. I have made it clear that under no circumstances is he allowed to cart this guy around using my vehicle and my gas. I don't even care if he offers gas at this point, I don't want him in my car. Now, it may be because I feel my husband is fully being used at this point because a few of the places my husband has driven this guy has been a good 30 minutes away. That and I don't like the guy anyways. Never have. Mix that with the fact that he doesn't respect people's belongings (smokes blunt after blunt whenever my husband picks him up and leaves the vehicle reeking) and I'm just all set with having this man anywhere near my shit. So I told my husband this guy is not to be in my vehicle at all. He said ""Fine by me"" and we moved on.  Well, yesterday my husband calls me and he like sheepishly says ""John is begging me for a ride to go get his kid and I feel bad."" I reminded him that guy is not to be in my car. He said ""I know but like.. what am I supposed to say to him? I feel bad because he did loan me that money a while back."" So I said ""Yeah, money that you've already paid back. He is not to be in my car and if you go against my wishes you won't be taking my car again."" Well, the guy happened to walk up to the car window when I said this and my husband had me on speaker (per usual) so he heard me and got pissed. Said that he would never help us out again and I was controlling and ignorant. My husband did defend me, absolutely and told him he had better ""watch his fucking mouth"". But now my husband is saying I put him in a terrible position because he works with the guy. I told him that just because he works with him doesn't mean he needs to be a push over and get walked on.

I’m not sure if legally that’s relevant because I can’t find any info on it, but maybe fellow teachers will know.   It’s January now, so we’ve been in school for almost five months. I work at a school with disadvantaged youth and I knew that going into it. I expected difficulties, but I also expected to see people working to resolve them. During the last five months, I’ve expressed (and emailed) countless times about various issues I’ve witnessed and made sure to include ideas for solutions and offered my own time during prep times or after school to help with these issues. I’ll include a few below.   - troubled students who need psychological evaluation and services  - troubled students who are severely behind and need targeted interventions and tutoring  - students with severe truancy issues   - shortage of basic, necessary supplies like pencils, papers, sanitation supplies (tissue, wipes, etc)  - teacher burn out (this one is tricky, but one solution I gave and I’m currently working on is renovating the teachers lounge to make it a bit more relaxing)  - new teacher educational opportunities (I proposed having 15 minutes of our dedicated weekly PD time go to teachers voluntarily picking a topic and presenting a tip or idea to help out new teachers, which we have a ton in our school, think “what I wish I had learned the easy way”)  Anyway, so these are just a few. My boss doesn’t respond to any of my emails or messages. If I catch him around the school, he listens and acts like he cares, but then he doesn’t actually take any action to address these issues (that I can tell).  Which brings me to my question. Last week I was informed that I was scheduled for a formal teacher observation, a week after having had an informal observation (which I still haven’t received any feedback for). I asked to wait until I receive that feedback, and my email was ignored. I don’t even know if long term subs need to be observed, from a policy/legal perspective. I was also informed that it would be recorded, which makes me very uncomfortable because I hate being recorded or photographed in general. My boss said that all formal observations have to be recorded because multiple people in higher up positions would be reviewing the tapes.   So would I be an asshole if I maliciously comply and use my observation to subtly point out a lot of the issues I’ve thus far brought up and been ignored about?"

My ex gf (17F) and I (17F) dated for about 6 months but began arguing over some smaller things like this. At least she made me feel like they were small. So, one day before our homecoming dance, she had my best friend (we’ll call her P) homecoming propose to her as a joke with a minimal effort poster and my ex gf (we’ll call her K) acted all happy and continued playing into the joke all while one of my closest friends recorded it (she didn’t know I wasn’t okay with the joke). They had joked around about it days prior to it actually happening which I was uncomfortable with and voiced in passing that if they did that I would be a bit upset. I never thought they would actually do it though.  So, when it happened, I didn’t talk to P or K for the rest of that class and you could tell I was upset. But I decided to miss our school’s pep rally (since we had free blocks during those periods) because she needed to walk her dog since her brother neglected to that day and I didn’t want her to walk home alone. On the walk home, I was still silent but decided to try to talk it out once we approached her house.  I told her that I didn’t get why she would do that, that I told her it would make me upset and that I told her not to do it (which wasn’t true because apparently I did not but she didn’t tell me till days later). She kept defending herself saying it was just a joke and it was supposed to be funny and I replied with a joke is supposed to be funny to everyone involved and it wasn’t.   We argued back and forth for around an hour which she kept giving me excuses for the joke saying she thought it would only be a slap on the wrist from me for doing it, which made me even more upset. She even told me that I’m always getting upset which makes her upset which stuck with me since I never thought I always got upset with her until that point. I’m not the type of person to get upset without a reason so when she said that it hurt.   Eventually, I took the blame and boiled it down to I overreacted and should’ve told her more that I wasn’t okay with the joke. She never apologized either. Then later that night I wanted to address why she thought I always got upset which spurred another argument which lasted into the day of homecoming.   We eventually dropped the whole issue and pushed it aside to “have fun at homecoming”, which we did, but continued to have arguments like these which always ended with me taking the blame for overreacting and making her upset by being upset. We broke up later that month as well.  Everyone I talk to about this in my friend group (since her and I have the same friends) says I’m TA in this situation because I overreacted and didn’t make it clear that I would be upset over the joke. But I feel that it never should’ve happened in the first place without me knowing not without my consent. Even though this happened months ago, i wanted some unbiased outside opinions. So, AITA?"

She also tried to convince him that I’m manipulating him even though the move was both of our ideas. On top of all of that, she made a comment about my grandma who has terminal cancer. She said “you could just push the wedding back since she’s not going to make it anyway” and then claimed it was supposed to make me feel good. She also said “right now is not a good time for you to have a baby, but it might be a good time for us.” She lost her son (34) last year and pretty much wants to take care of the baby for us.

Full disclosure, I've given up being the asshole and now ride a bike or jam up the main street like everybody else but I'm still irritated by the situation.  The diagram pretty much says it all, but if I live in the neighborhood and approach the school parking lot from the north to pick up my kid it's evidently a big deal because its like I'm cutting in line.     However my contention is that queueing on the side street allows people to safely and calmly get into the neighborhood, relieves traffic on the main road and effectively allows everyone to get where they're going faster.  It should be a very typical traffic zipper into any other congested area, but because most traffic is coming from the other way it seems to be problematic in spite of the fact that its the rational way to operate.  It's a 2 way street and there's no signage indicating any required action- yes, coming from that direction will typically get you a shorter line.  It doesn't change the fact that it's a better plan.  I wish more people would do it."

My position is I'm pretty busy in the morning, it isn't my job to wake you up as well. My morning routine is: alarm goes off at 6:25, I lay there for about 5m.  6:30, I go wake up 2 of our kids (10f, 6m).  The oldest, 12f, has a later start time and pretty much takes care of herself until it's time for me to take her. Including waking herself up, making her own breakfast and lunch, etc.  Younger 2 sleep like the dead and it usually takes me 5-10min to get our son up.  They get dressed while I go put the dog out, feed him, make my coffee, make their breakfast and their lunches. They have to be out the door for the bus at 7:05 so I'm usually cattle prodding them along to keep them on time. This morning my husband walked in at 6:55, usual time, while I was making lunches and told me he wants to get up in the morning too.  That I should wake him up with a kiss and that he's usually awake anyway so it's no big deal. My question was, if you're already awake and want to get up, why don't you? This is the first time he has ever told me I'm supposed to wake him up.   Wrong thing to ask. He got huffy and then made a comment about liking coffee too while he slammed around the kitchen. I tried to talk to him about it later and as far as we got was him rather passive aggressively telling me he gets it, that I'm busy and don't have time to do something simple for him. He works off shore for weeks at a time, so when he is home he doesn't have a job to go to. I have a part time job I go to while the kids are in school. That is a whole other source of conflict. Me having a job at all, not that it's just part time.  Why I may be TA: it wouldn't take me much time to give him a kiss and tell him it's time to get up, and I could make him a coffee with mine. He works away from home for weeks at a time with an unpredictable schedule. He provides most of the money.  Why I don't think I'm TA: he's an adult. I carry all the mental load of the house when he is gone for work.  He does some things when he comes home, but nowhere near 25% much less half. Adding on the responsibility of telling him it's time to get up and making his coffee every morning kind of makes me feel like he's another kid, not my partner.  So AITA here?"

Truth be told, it was my first time using wireless ones and I really wasn't able to get used to it. I had a constant feeling that they are too big for my ears and are going to slip off (it wasn't because of buds' size, it was the matter of design) because of what using them was making me really anxious. As a result, I was almost never using them, unless I was at home and mostly sticked to the wired ones while being outside.   Nonetheless I appreciated comfort of not having wires dangling around me. So, when my friend gave me for Christmas a gift card to a big electronic store, I decided to buy myself another wireless pair of headphones. This time however I chose them myself, making sure that they'll be comfortable for me to use. It was a great purchase, I love the new headphones and using them really makes me happy, as it's far more comfortable to talk with my closed ones whenever I want to (my family lives quite far away and I call them almost daily).  Few days ago John noticed my new headphones and got really upset with me. He says that I am unresponsible, buying something that I already own and that I should spend the card on somethinh I really need. The thing is, I don't need any new electronic at the moment and I wanted to have headphones which I'd like using. I told him so but he keeps saying that in this case I should leave the gift card for now ""for emergency"". Also, that I am childish and create problems out of nothing as he doesn't know anybody who'd have problems with the model of headphones he gave me, so I should be more appreciative of his gift.  I got upset and told him that since it's *my* gift card then I can use it however I want and he accused me of having a spending problem. I really doubt that it's the case (I don't earn too much but I never had any problems with uncontrolled purchases or debt, too) but maybe he's right and I should try more to get used to my headphones from him? Maybe I really am childish, after all.  AITA for buying new unnecessary headphones even if he already bought me a pair?"

I’ve been lurking here for a while but truly need some advice…sorry it’s kinda long. My wife (46F) and I (50M) have had a tough couple years.  Married for 6 years, together about 11, we share 4 kids (2 each).  Three boys are working away and stay with us when they get home, which is rare.  My stepdaughter (15F) is a great kid and is a pleasure to raise. Wife moved across country to go to school for 1.5 yrs, we saw each other every 4-6 wks during this time.  Then she moved home for a month and took a temporary job that requires her to travel, she’s only home on wknds for the next 3-4 months then gone for good.  So we’ve spent a lot of time apart and it’s adding up.  She wasn’t supposed to have to move again but needed to to complete her certification.  This whole thing was to double her pay and she has. I am at home with the child, I care for her like she’s my own and she keeps me very busy.  I also work 2 jobs so life is hectic but we manage. Here’s the issue: wife gets to come home early last night-one night early - and I’m excited for sex and tell her so.  She comments that she hopes I miss “all of her”.  I take that as her meaning all I want is sex and that’s she’s just an object.  I am mad. She gets home, we talk about it and she says she just wishes I would put more energy into non-sexual activities.  I take that as either she doesn’t want sex as much as me and I am pushing it way too much or she is not attracted to me and either way my libido is dead now.  We go to bed, me seething and her asking if we can have sex to which I say no.  It’s not to punish her, I am actually just frustrated and truly exhausted and want her to know that I can go (and have went) without sex for long periods of time. Some details you may need:  I quit drinking just over 2 yrs ago since I knew I needed to if I was going to properly care for a teen by myself.  I started some antidepressants in dec since winter is always brutal for me and and I’ve tried to tune in everything else-diet, exercise, sleep, etc and the pills work, sex drive is fine and I’m way less cranky and can actually share how I feel. We have a great sex life and it’s only gotten better over the years.  On the wknds she’s been home these past few months we probably average 3-5 sessions in a wknd and I figured we were in sync about that. Now I’m not sure.  I feel totally shut down and one of the only things getting me through this tough time has been looking forward to our rendezvous.  Now i feel shut down and would be happy to just go sexless -I guess it’s to punish her but also I want to show her it’s not all about the sex.  It’s not the one thing I used to look toward to right now. I was married to a very abusive woman in the past so my wife thinks I fight like a pro while she just shuts down and gets quiet.  I’ve asked her to open up since I’d rather know what’s up than guess…I work all day today but can’t concentrate at all, told her we need to talk tonight.  She’s only home until Sunday and I work all wknd…"

He looked hurt and asked if I really felt he should give up.

He argued with me that if he got his organization under control he'd be fine, but I told him it wasn't just that, it was his tendency to dismiss any info that doesn't fit his preconceived ideas to the point where he won't even check the school admissions website because he's convinced he already knows what to do. He wants to do high level scientific research, but is struggling with the low level info gathering that he needs to do now.  He got really upset, and I told him I was sorry I really wasn't trying to hurt him and I feel bad that this hasn't worked out. AITA for telling him what I really think?"

We do have our differences though - I'm a bit of an extrovert and my sister has always been a very overly sensitive person, introverted, and extremely self-conscious (if she doesn't think she looks good, she won't go outside) My parents and I used to tease her by calling her hotheaded, but recently my parents have started catering to her sensitive behavior. I'm in university a couple of states away, close enough to visit occasionally but obviously I'm not always around. My parents and my sister have gotten really close in the time that I've been away, and I didn't realize they decided to stop teasing her about her sensitivity; I thought that was still our running joke.  I occasionally rant to my cousin (31F) about my sister since we are all very close (we're pretty much all just sisters), and my cousin agrees that my sister has always been sensitive and gets annoyed easily, and sympathizes with me when my sister is being short.  My sister and my parents came to the conclusion (without letting me know) that my sister may have some deeper sensitivity issues and she might not just be a hormonal teenager. I came back for break once and I called my sister a hothead because she was getting mad that she couldn't get a box open, and my mom defended her when she got upset I called her that. I called out my mom for taking her side (not knowing that the family had decided to baby her) and I went upstairs visibly upset. My dad noticed and called my whole family up, and in the heat of the conversation we were having I told them that I tell my cousin about our fights and that she validates my feelings and gives me input. My mom and sister blew up at me for making my sister look bad to other family. My sister has always tended to overthink things and hyperfocuses on mistakes (she's very socially awkward and will think about things she said for days or weeks) and now she says that she won't be able to forget that my cousin thinks about her differently for being sensitive. My mom said that she had been making huge progress in her self-confidence, and that I ruined all of that progress by revealing that I ranted about her.  I don't think I did anything wrong, and talking about things that bother me is just my way of coping with my problems. I don't think my family understands that that's just how I deal with things. My sister and I haven't spoken for over a month, and I don't feel the need to apologize. At the end of the day, I'm her older sister, not her mom, and she needs to realize not everyone will cater to her needs. AITA?"

I also have 2 kids (10m and 12f).  My husband's ex had mental health issues and my husband didn't want her alone with the kids so shortly after they got married, he hired Lucia (mid-late 50's at the time) to take care of his stepdaughter, then later their kids. He was eventually able to leave his ex and they moved to be closer to his family. He didn't want to fire Lucia so she moved in with them.  Lucia is very close with these kids. They call her grandma, she taught them Spanish, and she's very loving towards the kids. It's not unusual to see the youngest sitting in Lucia's lap while they watch a movie and she hugs and kisses them all the time.  My kids and I moved in and, while she's nice to us, she treats my kids like an afterthought. I don't pay her for my kids. They take the bus to school and are capable of walking to and from the bus stop, making themselves a snack, and doing their homework. The only thing she needs to do is, when she makes dinner, I need her to make some for my kids.  &amp;#x200B;  There are two problems with this arrangement. First, she makes Mexican food all the time. My kids don't eat Mexican food so my daughter ends up making dinner for herself and her brother half the time. Second, she's extremely loving to my husband's kids while pretty much ignoring mine. It wouldn't kill them to speak English around my kids or for her to not hug and kiss them every 30 seconds. It makes my kids uncomfortable and a little jealous.  I told my husband about this and he said he didn't know what I was expecting since Lucia had been with those kids for 12 years. I told him to talk to Lucia about making things fair between the kids. Speak English so my kids could be included in the conversation, make food that all of the kids like, include my kids in their outings (once a week Lucia picks the kids up from school and takes them out to get ice cream or hot chocolate and sometimes they go out for dinner after that).   My husband says no because his kids love Lucia's Mexican food, the ice cream has been a tradition with the 4 of them for 7 years, the kids will start to forget their Spanish if they don't speak it regularly with Lucia, and because she's been their grandma since the oldest was 3 and the younger two were born so having her change anything now will be harmful to his kids.  I told him that he can't just think of his kids anymore and that keeping things the way they are is harmful to my kids but he's refusing to change anything and is blaming everything on me because I was the one that told Lucia that my kids don't need a nanny and didn't invite her to any family activities so she could become closer with my kids.  Since he's refusing to talk to her about it himself, I'm considering talking to her but I wanted to know if I was the asshole for wanting my husband to do it"

Whilst having a spare room I've never had anyone else live with me. Recently though a friend was in a dire situation so I said I'd rent them the room cheap so that they could get out of their toxic boyfriend's place.   The friend, now roommate, has a history of mental health but no official diagnosis. They are also nocturnal, typically waking up about 4pm. I myself struggle so can empathize but despite my mental health issues I am fiercely independent. My roommate I have learnt is not...  The apartment is a 5 minute walk from a huge grocery store. Every time they'd want to do their groceries they'd ask me to go with them to help carry it back as ""due to their mental and physical health"", they are unable to do it alone. Initially I was happy to help but they then came to expect me to help them every time to which I began refusing and have only done so since when is convenient to me as I work full-time and they do not work at all. This hasn't been a problem since standing my ground.   After a couple months of living together however, they asked if they could keep a stray cat that had been hanging around the complex. Which I agreed to on the condition I do not take care of it.   The issue is now though cat litter. They say they can't carry it back from the grocery store. They asked me to help and I said yes but emphasised I had plans in the evening. I knocked on their door at 2pm to ask if they wanted to get the cat litter and they asked if we could do it later as they were still sleeping to which I reminded them I was busy. They then asked if it was possible to do it the next day then instead to which I said yes but it would have to be early in the afternoon as I wanted to keep my evening open. I asked if they could get up earlier, they just laughed and proceeded to get pissed at me. Ever since they've been really cold and distant with me.   It's made me feel like a bad friend for not helping but equally the cat isn't my responsibility nor is their health.  I cared for my dad and when I was younger because my mom was to depressed to do it and in turn I ended up having to look after her as well. I think this is why I'm so independent and had chosen to live alone up until now, I just want to look after myself. I don't get much time off work, so when I do, I want time for me. I want to help my roommate with their problems of course which is why I gave them somewhere to live and agreed to the cat. I didn't expect the support to extend beyond that though... Is that selfish?

My son, that hubby adopted, was 10 when we married. My son was super hyper and socially immature for his age. My hubby has a son that's a year younger and was quiet and calm (like the rest of his side of the family’s kids).   My MIL once made my son cry over some crumbs in our kitchen. MIL baked a box of brownies with her bio grandson (which was a box my son and I were supposed to use to bake for neighbors). When brownies were done, my son got one and it made her so upset he left crubs that she yelled at him! To the point he ran off so she wouldn't see him cry. He was 11 years old at this point.  She has jumped on him for silly things, dog piling when me or hubby we're already getting into my son about something minor. But if her bio grandson did the same thing, she was quiet about it...despite being the same issue in front of her. An example is when asking to eat more of the take out ordered.  My in laws relied on my son to help take care of sister and house when I had my last child. My sin helped show them where stuff around house is, clean, and take out garbage. The bio grandson sat in room upstairs and played video games.  My son with dydlexia, dysgraphia, ADd/ADHD graduated high school with 3.8 GPA, during Covid. I told her about it over the phone. She did not offer congrats, send a card, etc.  Her bio grandson, got kicked out of 2 schools, private and magnet, and was very lazy. My hubby's parents made excuses (he's too smart because he's in gifted program, etc). My stepson evevtually was allowed to graduate with less credits- just to get him out of school! Christmas comes and my little girls with hobby got cards, my stepson got a card from MIL. My son got nothing.  I texted her and told MIL that I felt like it was mean that she couldn't bother putting tan extra Christmas card in for my son, asking why she sent stepson money and card for graduating (snd brought that up in front of me when did nothing for my son!), and why she's harder on my kid.  MIL called me crying, telling me to stop. Asking don't I know how much they love my son, that I am insecure. I admitted that may be the case, maybe I need reassurance at this point. But the entire time she cried, insisted she treats all kids the same, she got bio grandson grad gift because his mom sent a formal graduation announcement to her, and she claims she never sent a Christmas card to my stepson.  I took on lots of blame- admitting I could be insecure, apologizing for making her cry. She never uttered an apology or anything resembling that she heard my feelings.  Then…she said her husband will not make it to his birthday (next month- he’s in amazing shape, btw) and she will die soon too. Then I will be happy?!  I told her that wasn’t a fair statement, I don’t wish death on them, etc.  Am I an a-hole???"

The trip was for five days. Ella and Mike are also a couple, while the remaining three people mentioned are single. Prior to booking the trip, Greg and I made it clear that while it was a friends' holiday, as a couple we’d also like to sometimes go off and do our own thing, which everyone said was cool.   We arrive at the hotel on the first night, and most people are tired from traveling and want to relax by drinking or eating at the hotel bar. Greg and I are itching to explore the city, though, so tell the group we'll join them at the bar later, but we want to get out and explore. Jake asks if he can join us, and we say sure.   About an hour after we leave, Tom starts spamming my phone, asking us to come back to the bar and hang out with everyone else. We say we'll return in a while, but we're having too much fun exploring the city. My phone then runs out of battery, and Jake's and Greg's phones aren't working in the foreign country. The next day, Tom was sulking because everyone else at the hotel bar ended up going to bed early, and he'd tried texting my phone to ask where we were so he could join, but obviously I never got the messages as my phone died. He wouldn't let it go all day, and said we should have all stuck together.   The second day of the trip, the entire group hung out together all day and evening. Then, on the third day, Tom was dead set on traveling one hour to a different region of the country as he had an old school friend who grew up in the region (note: his friend no longer lives in the region, so there was no pressing reason for him to go).   We googled the region, and it looked like a residential suburban area with nothing to do. So Greg and I said we'd sit it out and do some activities in the more tourist-friendly city, and everyone else agreed. Tom got into a sulk, so Sam agreed to go with him to the other region, but like we predicted, they ended up wasting a day of the trip as there was nothing but residential houses and one small café in the area.  On day four of the trip, we all hung out together again, but on the final day, Greg and I had a date day and evening together, and Ella and Mike did the same. The three single guys hung out together. We’ve been home from the trip a few days now, and Tom has been in a foul mood and complaining his vacation was ""ruined""  He claims it wasn’t cool of the couples to go off and do our own thing as it was a ""friend holiday"" and that we all should have stuck together as a group at all times rather than doing what we wanted as individuals.  I don’t think I am in the wrong or an asshole, so I won’t apologize. But am I the asshole?"

He moved out over 10 years ago.  My husband knew I didn’t want children here all the time (his were pretty young). I was a mother quite early in life and I was done with kids and wanted to have a clean home and peace and quiet.  I didn’t want the responsibility of cooking and cleaning up after kids anymore.  So they’d visit for one day when he had them for the weekend.    Fast forward to 5 months after we married.….his son was kicked out of school (at 22) and didn’t want to live with this mother, so my husband insisted he live with us.  Said it would only be for a few months.  This is the house I owned before we married.  He did this knowing full well how I felt about it.  It’s been off and on for over 5 years.  He comes, stays for a few months, then leaves, then comes back.  Sometimes when he left, his daughter would stay for the summer.  I’ve asked when this will end to be greeted with anger. I’ve asked him to have his kids clean up after themselves, not leave garbage in the spare room, or the bathroom, to also be met with anger.  They don’t clean the bathroom.  He lived with us for 2 years straight basically and wouldn’t clean the bathroom even when I asked him to.    I’m tired of it now.  I’ve actually had to tell them myself that they need to clean up after themselves as I’m not a maid and this isn’t their house.  I don’t care if they come and spend the weekend but I resent having to completely clean two rooms of garbage after they’ve been here for a month or so.

She refused and said that I shouldn’t worry about it- accidents happen after all- but now I’ve found out that she’s going behind my back and telling all our mutual friends about it. She isn’t saying it directly but she’s heavily implying that I didn’t try to do anything about it.

She also tried to convince him that I’m manipulating him even though the move was both of our ideas. On top of all of that, she made a comment about my grandma who has terminal cancer. She said “you could just push the wedding back since she’s not going to make it anyway” and then claimed it was supposed to make me feel good. She also said “right now is not a good time for you to have a baby, but it might be a good time for us.” She lost her son (34) last year and pretty much wants to take care of the baby for us.

Henry then proposed that in order to help him train, we should do a race between Brad and me to see who was faster. I thought it sounded fun but Brad was relunctant. He ultimately agreed because he didn't want to go against his father desires. My dad was also against the idea but at first I didn't understand why.  My father privately told me that if won the race, Henry would be very disappointed with Brad and that it could be very bad for the both of them. He explained that the divorce has been very difficult for Brad and Henry's relationship, so Brad's training has been a method for them to bond. He being defeated by a girl would destroy all that. He said that I should lose on porpuse but I totally refused to do anything like that. He seemed really worried  about Brad but I was not going to do it.  We did the race and it was fair and square with both of us giving our best. Brad beat me but not by much. Henry looked reasonably satisfied and Brad acted like a really good winner, being happy but also congratulating me in my intense performance.

I invited my parents and they paid for the tickets -60$ each.Ticket price included a buffet. I would've opted out of the buffet if possible. I hate buffets.  When we arrived it was massively crowded, the room with the tables and the stage was packed. When everyone sat, it was barely possible for a thin person to walk sideways between the tables. With around 300 people in the room, it was awfully loud and impossible to make conversation + there was a speaker next to us.  After 3 hours of ear torture it was time for the buffet at 8:30pm I was already considering asking my parents to move to a restaurant when the ceremony is over but I wanted to wait and see how the buffet would be handled.

I declined,she doesn't know what I like to eat anyways.The evening that was supposed to be ""me being celebrated"" turned into ""my wishes being ignored"".  I decided to ignore my parents and just sit on my phone after 20min they came back from the buffet. My mum made remarks how the food was good but i ignored it. It didn't look good to me anyways. When both were done I looked at them and said: ""great if you are done, can we leave?""  My mum asked me why I was being bitchy and I just said: ""you really don't know? you have no idea why I am pissed after you declined my proposal even though I would've paid?""

I stopped close to the entrance, no car behind me, at it was late at night and there was no activity on this alley. He raised his voice and started to yell at me for not moving further up and more off to the side to do this. Berating me about how unsafe I was being. When I asked him to not yell and just tell me, he got even more angry because, since his point is right his behavior is justified.

My wife does not do a lot in the household. No cooking, only basic cleaning, drives kid 2 a week to some lessons (takes 5min).  Since the kid was born, she started to be combatative and throws arguments over just anything, like breadcrumb on countertop. She earns $70k and I do $160k (I can support house on my own).  I do: cleaning (30%), help with laundry, dishes, cooking 100% (2 meals a day), groceries, renovation of house (did painting, plastering, floors, doors, insulation myself), fixing stuff driving to kindergarten multiple times a day (2 back and forth). I do spend time with kid and do the all duties. She only puts the kid to bed – that's all.  I'm unhappy and miserable.   **Should I try to change her or kick her.**"

I am still on maternity leave and my husband will stay home for a while after I return to work, but the baby is reaching a age where it would be okay to have someone else watch her for short periods.   We have discussed a lot about the ways we want to raise out children among the years and it has come up how my husband was physically disciplined as a kid. He isn’t traumatized from it (his own words) but recognizes that it was not okay even though it was way more common in his childhood than now. We want to do gentle parenting and obviously, no physical or emotional violence allowed. We have discussed how we want everyone who is with the baby to obey the same ground rules. I especially have said that his mother needs to be informed that she cant treat our child the same way he raised my husband. My husband agrees but has a hard time discussing difficult or negative topics especially with his family, he is going to therapy though.   I recently visited MIL with the baby and the topic of her babysitting came up. I decided that this would be a good time to discuss the subject of how we would like people around the baby to act. I explained gentle parenting etc. and how no type of violence would be allowed. My MIL kind of laughed at this and wondered who would want to hurt a child and how it’s not rocket science to raise a kid. I then brought up the ways my husband was physically disciplined as a kid as examples of what’s not okay. MIL said again that she doesn’t understand why this is discussed since those things are so ”obviously wrong”. Then I kind of got annoyed and said that well, she did them in my husband’s childhood so I saw it as fit to mention.   She clearly got kind of sad/offended and said that it’s different when it’s your own kid, how times are different and how she feels bad that we need to dig the past and don’t trust her as a caregiver. She also mentioned that she would feel more comfortable discussing this with my husband. We kind of left it at that and I went home shortly after.   I told my husband about our interaction and he had no problem with me bringing it up since he agrees and finds these types of discussions with her mother really hard. But I wonder if I should’ve ”forced” him to do it anyways or just not bring up his childhood at all to MIL since it clearly hurt her."

I was a teen (am 33yo now) and was used to rationing at my aunts house states away in the summer. I would normally go with my other aunt and uncle and it was the week l most looked forward to. my cousin is a few years younger then me, but we had a good relationship and always played really well together. Well on like the second or third day my aunt Chastired me for not cleaning the house while they were at work and I was in the house ""doing nothing"". I didn't have any transportation and I was content to just be alone and relax, It was summer break and I was there just so I could have extra time with my cousin and so I could just get away (my home life was super shit). I will also add that I did clean up after myself and that I have always been a clean person and very careful not to make a mess in someone else's home, so I definitely wasn't trashing their house.   So AITA (or was I) for not cleaning their house every day while they were at work?  My aunt claimed it was only nice and proper for a house guest to clean the hosts house as a thank you... My thoughts have always been that I don't go on vacation or visit someone to clean... Also I would NEVER expect a guest to clean anything except to clean up after themselves (Dishes in the sink at least, Trash in the trash can, etc etc etc... ) because to me, I have guests because I enjoy their company, and they're on vacation."

He's a purebred Aussie Shepherd and he really he's my best bud now (cliché, I know.)     For the most part he's a great dog, lots of personality, intelligent, and a huge cuddle baby, for at least me and my spouse. Over the years he has gotten grumpy and I try to do all I can do to fix it, walks to get energy out, playing to exhaust him, treat training, etc. We have had kids since we got him, another dog, and some cats. He's fine with the other dog, they play and get along, sometimes get snippy, and our oldest cats he ignores for the most part.      We got a new kitten and something just switched in my dogs' brain. When he ignores the other cats, he gets uncontrollably excited about this kitten, I don't think he's being malicious, but he'll dart at them and basically pile steamroll them over and nose jab them alot (It's a weird Aussie thing). And yes, that behavior is a problem, a 50lb dog running at 3lb kitten like that and I am working on it as much as I can daily.      Anyway, the Kitten doesn't leave our bedroom much, mostly because of the dog, but I try to get them to leave so they can explore the house and get used to everything, our Aussie saw the kitten, ran at them, scared the bejesus of them.      My spouse immediately just screams at him (as they often do, instead of trying to help with the actual training) and followed it up with ""I don't even fucking like this dog anymore"". And when I called them out and said ""Don't say that and screaming at them isn't helping his training"". they rolled their eyes and shook their head, mouthing something, not sure what. I called them out again ""Don't roll your eyes at me like a spoiled teenager, that's childish.""      They then stormed off, slammed our bedroom door and haven't spoken to me since. AITA?"

10mng4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10mng4z/aita_for_using_the_treadmill_at_my_building_gym/,1674832993,1,AITA for using the treadmill at my building gym for 4 hours?,"   Basically title. My building has a small resident's gym with about 8 pieces of cardio equipment, 3 bikes, 3 stair / elliptical machines, and 4 treadmills (on top of some strength training machines / weights areas / 2 benches).  I use the treadmill for 4 hours a day (light jog, it's not like I'm Usain Bolting for that long) from 6AM to 10AM (gym operates 6AM to 10PM). During this time the gym is almost empty from 6-7:45\~ and again from 8:30\~ to 10AM, Pre 7:45 seems too early for people and post 8:30 too late (assume getting ready / starting work etc.).  I'd say at an absolute MAXIMUM all 4 treadmills are occupied for perhaps 15 minutes every other day. I did a test today and for the entire 4 hours there was at least one treadmill free, and I was alone for over 3 hours of the run. There are plenty of days where capacity isn't hit at all, and the days on which it is it's a very limited time slot from maybe 8:15-8:30. On average I probably run alone for over half the time and with 1-2 others (So still at least 1 treadmill free) for the entirety of the rest.  I understand the concerns around hogging equipment and I'm not remotely denying 4 hours is a very long time. However, there is clearly capacity in the gym (which in Manhattan we pay a ludicrous amount to live in anyway, obviously). You could argue I should step off from 8;15-8:30 if I can see the gym is full, but even then it's 15minutes 1-2 times a WEEK that all 4 are in use.   Either way, we got an e-mail from management reminding us the max to be on any cardio equipment is 45 minutes. I am 99% sure it's aimed at me, as this morning about 3 hours in a lady (I believe the building manager's assistant) informed of the rule tapping me on the shoulder. I continued asking why it's a rule and gestured at the 3 free treadmills next to me. I asked if I hop to another treadmill does that comply with the rule? What about switching to Peloton? She didn't have an answer and just said the rule ""comes from management"" and left. 15 minutes later a doorman comes, same thing, same conversation, he asks my apartment number and I tell him, and he again repeats it's from management and walks off  Am I insane or am I missing something here? If the treadmills were in high demand and I was single handedly blocking 25% capacity for the entire morning slot I would of course be a gigantic asshole with no consideration for others with busy schedules. As I have tried to point out in this post that is NOT the case. I'm sure some people will say clearly I'm not telling the truth as clearly people have complained or something. There are cameras in the gym and if management confronts me I will challenge them to review footage and if they can find more than a 15minute slot at once or 30 minutes throughout the entire week where  all 4 are in use (when I'm there) I will back down.   I really don't understand, but, reddit, am I missing something and am I in fact the asshole?"

Well, the point is that before we had a person who helped us cook but we had to move and we still couldn't hire anyone, plus we had a baby a few months ago and we don't have that much time to cook for everyone every time someone comes home.   The point is that my daughter (7F) made new friends and they wanted to come home for lunch so I told his parents that I didn't have time to cook and that if they were okay with me giving them vegan food, because although it sounds crazy, many people don't allow their children to eat ""that"". some of them said that they would bring their own food and others that it was okay if they ate vegan food. Well, the day came and no one brought their own food so I fed them what I had at home (which since our baby was born is mostly prepared and frozen food) they ate vegan cheese burgers with fries and vegan ice cream for dessert and the truth is that the kids loved it, because it was nothing from another world, just a meal made in another way.   One of the girls (8F) said that she liked the food and that she would like to stop eating meat because she loves animals too, and I honestly don't know why she said that because I only cooked for them, I didn't tell them anything else. But apparently my daughter did tell them something, and her friend told her parents what she ate and what she thought about animals and now her parents are mad because they think that what I did was wrong. For them it was not right to give their daughter vegan food and that the best thing would have been to order a pizza, that feeding them that only makes them think ""stupid things"", but I don't think it was bad, it's just food and anyway I warned before that if they didn't want me to eat that they should bring their own food.

I told him that if he didn't like the arrangement, then he was able to leave or stay at his moms (she lives five miles away) but that my decision was final.

When I was a young child maybe 6-8 years old we happened across a small baby bird (found in pool pump floating strainer ). After keeping the bird in a box for a day or two, it got out one day. Initially the bird was just in the backyard so I went and got my mom (38) to help get it back in the box. At the time she was doing this thing called decopage and unfortunately was in the middle of it. After letting her know I went back outside to find the bird had made its way around the side of the house. At this point young me is starting to freak out and I run back inside to get mom again only to find she has not moved an inch. After frantically asking for help I return outside to find the bird in the front yard and now approaching the road. This road is busy, 35mph zone and nobody does the limit. Against my best efforts the baby bird hops its little way towards the road and I watch as it gets flattened to a pancake.  Instantly defeated and now obviously sobbing, I walk back inside to find my mother in the exact same spot. I let her know she let me down, almost got her kid killed, and I will never forgive her for this. That happened about 25 years ago and I have not forgotten. This event was only brought up once since it happened, and she did not seem terribly remorseful. Her response was ""So I was a bad mother?"" at the time her visiting wasn't on the line and I didn't delve into it further with her.   As an adult who now lives on my own, I recently decided to get two cats (Actually, one adopted me and then I had no choice but to get her a cuddle buddy. That can be a story for another day.). I love these cats. I would do anything for the little biscuit factories. Well, a few months go by and life is great. I get asked by mom when she can visit and suddenly my stomach sinks. I don't want her near my cats. I don't trust her, and I don't feel bad about it. Then I start thinking, man... that's kind of extreme to not let your mom into your house because of something that happened 25 years ago. I am conflicted. Am I the asshole here?  For the time being I have been playing it off, busy weekends. Schedules not lining up. Not feeling well. At this point I really just want to come clean or at least quit playing a charade as to why I am avoiding having her over. It just doesn't feel right.

We really got along from the start and almost never got into a proper fight, apart from a few little disagreements. But about a week ago he started texting a girl he knows from Instagram. He only knew her over social media and I was never really bothered by the fact, that they were texting. But what started with texting on Instagram, turned into them exchanging numbers and my boyfriend meeting up with her to help with fixing her broken car. From the very start of their first interaction my boyfriend was trying to hider her from me. When I texted him once to ask what he was doing he responded with ""nothing"", only for me to find out later that he was meeting the other girl at that time. Yesterday he had an important appointment in a different town, where he not only met up with the other girl, but also invited her to lunch and spent about 5 hours with her. When he got back, I confronted him about it and said that I didnt understand why he would do something like that, considering he never once invited me to lunch. He assured me that there was nothing wrong and he wasnt interested in her. I told him how fed up I was with his double standards, because he expected me to keep my distance from a good male friend of mine and yet he was allowed to do something like this. A few hours later I find out that he actually also overed her to move in with him, because she didnt have a place to sleep. I got mad again and told him how hurt I was. He apologized and said he wouldnt do it again....Today he texts me that he has to run some errands and that he is taking her with him. So AITA?"

I'm going to be completely transparent to paint the best picture. I'm 29(f) and I am a recovering alcoholic. I have been sober for 5 months now (I believe, days are running together and I never wrote down the actual date). After I stopped drinking, my BC failed (doctors state it's due to my body being so used to alcohol that the chemicals in the BC no longer worked for my system). I'm currently 8 weeks pregnant. Obviously it wasn't planned but I do see this as a god send. I fully believe that this has changed my life for the better and even that this baby, my baby, has saved me. My husband and I are very excited. Scared shitless but excited.   All of my in laws know about my recovery. I've been with my husband for years and I couldn't even go to a family function without bringing booze. I had big issues. So they are all fully aware. They NEVER held it against me and have all been supportive but little comments have been thrown out there since finding out my pregnancy status and it's really like.. bothering me, I guess. Or not even bothering me but I just don't have the patience or tolerance for it. Like whenever I become irritated seemingly out of the blue (which I'm assuming is from my new found hormonal shift), the comments of ""oh it's because you're a dry drunk"" start in (for those wondering: dry drunk is a term they use when someone in recovery still gets the angry feelings they did from the alcohol, despite being sober- essentially). I've asked them to stop talking about it and usually they do.   But I had my MIL, both SILs and my own sister over yesterday for a little brunch/girl's day. I'm fatigued from hell and my morning sickness, while not severe, is picking up. The only thing I've been able to keep down is coffee and tuna fish, which I'm not supposed to eat a lot of, and cheese. It's been rough. Well, I make myself a coffee because for whatever reason it eases my stomach and my SIL immediately is at me. Starts saying ""You're not supposed to drink that!"" And ""You're just trading out one addiction for another""- after she saw me grab a second cup of coffee. I just kind of rolled my eyes and told her to get out. I was calm. I was just over it. She looked confused and started nervous laughing so I said ""No, I'm serious. Get out."" She did leave and it was pretty awkward after that. I'm just tired of her comments because it's usually her making them. Regardless, I've heard through the grapevine as of this morning that my MIL is telling everyone I was being ""petty as hell"" and that my SIL was just looking out for the baby. AITA?"

We enjoy drinking together and separately but I hate how he acts drunk.   Since Covid and kids he goes out maybe 3x/month but almost always gets pretty drunk, blacks out and loses track of time. When our 1st was ~6 weeks old he went out &amp; I encouraged him to put down his phone to stop texting me. He stopped being coherent and admitted his friend had gone home and he had picked up a girl at the bar, chatted her up, bought her drinks, went to a different bar with her for more drinks, exchange numbers and was texting with her until I caught him in his lie. We went to therapy and promised the world and he didn’t realize how disrespectful I’d think his actions were. after a few months if I asked for reassurance I was the bad guy for not being over it. Usually I asked respectfully but sometimes I was mean about it from being hurt and insecure still. I do not bring it up now unless we are fighting about how drunk he gets if even then. Ive asked he text me from time to time (I was also pregnant for a big chunk of this time and now have another newborn) &amp; communicate what time he expected to be home. Which started him telling me I was controlling.   He says asking for a rough time he will be home or update me if that changes is controlling. He almost always asks to have 1 more drink after that &amp; I say ok &amp; he stays for another hour+ losing track of time. But in that time he gets drunk. He swears he acts appropriate even if he doesn’t remember but I see when he gets home or when I’m out with him his inappropriate comments (recent examples are joking about his dick size to a friend of mine, putting me down in front of my family “lightheartedly”)  When he says he’ll be home at one time &amp; then keeps saying one more one more until it’s hours later (past midnight at least) then I’m annoyed. So he says I provoke him so it’s my fault he’s called me &amp; my family names like cunts and idiots, lied to me about who he was out with (when I’d have no issue with who he was with) and yelled at me with our newborn asleep 2 ft away.   I recorded the last time he yelled at me and he told me he was ashamed and he would start drinking less, so before he went out last night we discussed that again and he told me he wasn’t going to get drunk. Instead he stayed out 2 hours after he said he would but the real problem was he came home and couldn’t string a sentence together or keep his eyes open. I’m certainly not perfect but I am respectful of him and our relationship when I’m out. He could care less if I stay out late and always uses that against me but I always say that’s because I’m respectful and not sloppy when I get home. I also don’t stay out late &amp; I know that’s my choice.   AITA for asking him to not black out and be respectful? AITA for asking him to be home before midnight so he’ll have less drinks? AITA for taking away his release and trying to control the situation?"

We’re both 30, had a genuine connection, but didn’t label things since we had differing views on wanting to have kids. My other concerns were him being a smoker, still being attached to his ex, having had slept around a lot, and being a little hot and cold at times. He did seem honest.   I went away for a month to figure my feelings out for him and realised I did want to give it a fair shot. Before I was coming back, he invited me to go to his place from the airport but once I landed, he cancelled on me at the last moment with some excuse and then stopped responding. It was late at night and I didnt have a place of mine at that time. I was hurt that he did not even bother to ask where I was going to stay.   Next day, he came, apologised and gave me seemingly genuine excuses for his behaviour (a lot of them turned out to be lies). I forgave him and after a week, we had the what are we talk, we agreed to be with exclusive and it was all good. The week after, I felt something was off. One day, I saw another phone on his desk (an android since he is a developer), and it had notifications from another girl. It turned out he had been with her the night I came back, and had visited her after we made things exclusive. There were somewhat flirtatious exchanges with other girls too, one from the day we made things official. He convinced me these were platonic and the girl he had been visiting was his weed buddy and that he had never slept with her. He promised to stop talking with other potential girls, asked me to meet his friends, move in with him etc. I told him not to make false promises just to avoid conflict but he assured me he meant it. The next two months were riddled with anxiety. He did get better at texting and calling but he never made me meet his friends, never invited me to move in with him again, and kept stalling the STI tests which I had requested him to do. He would still stop replying mid conversation on some nights and be cold at times. My patience ran thin and I started questioning my sanity. I was convinced something was up and stalked his Instagram and noticed he was still befriending random women. He was travelling at the time and the limited contact made it worse for me. I FaceTimed him one day and expressed my concerns. He completely invalidated my insecurities but let it slip that he was indeed sleeping with his weed buddy at some point (apparently before we made things official). He told me he needed a week to think, during which he did not bother to check on me, even though he knew I was in a very bad place. After a week, we had a heated argument where he refused to take accountability. It’s been 3 months, I see him in office everyday. I’m living in the prison of my own mind, ruminating over what could have I done better. Am I not worthy, did I question him too much and pushed him away? What if he was actually not cheating? Should I have been more patient and given him time."

Today I was really really tired. I just started a new job and I’ve been working from 4:30 PM-12 AM. I haven’t been getting to bed until around 1:00-2:00 because I struggle to fall asleep.   I wake up usually around 10:00 AM, sometimes earlier so that my bf and I can get started with our day. We either go to the gym before I go to work or I accompany him while he does Doordash (just a way for him to make money on the side) I’m not obligated to but it helps him out and it means we have time to spend with each-other.   Today I work an earlier shift at noon. We were supposed to wake up at 9:00 AM, get ready to go to the gym and be back by 11:00 AM so I can get ready for work. My work is a 20-30 minute drive away and we’d have to leave by 11:30 which means both of us would need to shower and get ready in 30 minutes.   Normally we solve this by showering together, however, we’re staying with his mother for the time being and she’s really weird about us doing that.   In my opinion it’d be a lot easier to go tomorrow, which is my day off. We would have way more time and it would be less of a time crunch to deal with.   My boyfriend was really insistent on going today. Which is understandable. He didn’t want to skip his workout today. However I enjoy going together rather than separately and this takes pressure off both of us to be somewhere on time so I asked him if he’d stay home with me and we can go tomorrow.   He refused at first, however eventually caved but now he’s angry at me. Am I the asshole?"

R was lovely but always very quiet, A was loud and fun and at first a good friend. I ended up spending a few evenings a week at their house. After a while I saw them arguing where she'd tell him to get back to his own country and that she hopes he gets hit by a train etc. This arguing came from the fact she was trying to control his every move. Whenever I got the chance to speak to R in private I could see how miserable he was. I didn't have feelings for him at first but the more we got to speak the more I realised how wonderful a person he is.  September came around and A was on a trip so she asked R to help me move house and we got to spend some quality time together. We stayed up til the small hours talking - absolutely nothing happened between us. However we had a conversation about having feelings for each other. I asked him to give his marriage one last try. When A got back from her trip she immediately started laying into him and after a couple of days he told her he couldn't do it any more, they broke up and he moved out. Within a week she was dating one of Rs friends, and is using him the same way she used R (spending all HIS money on drugs, botox, filler, hair extensions etc). She showed me screenshots where the new guy said the same things R used to say - that she makes him feel awful about himself and treats him poorly, so safe to say it's a pattern.  R and I started spending more time together and it was a couple of weeks before anything happened between us, but 4 months later its the best relationship I've ever been in. He treats me so wonderfully and I've never been so happy, he accepts me as I am despite the fact I have a disability and struggle with my mental health. I continued being distant friends with A though she didn't know that R and I were still in contact as she told me I had to cut him out of my life. It got to the stage where she would ask me to not wear make-up when going to visit her and wear baggy clothes so she would feel better about herself, and over the past few months we became distant and haven't spoken in a couple of weeks.  I found out from her 3 weeks ago she has reported R to the home office to try and get him deported out of hatred, not knowing that he has already applied to switch his spousal visa to a work visa. We weren't going to tell her that we were together, but after everything she has done I'm reconsidering. After 4 years of being abusive towards him, using him, and in recent months of being manipulative and controlling towards me too I've had enough. So I want to tell her that we've been together for a few months and that I won't be a part of her life any more. On the other hand, maybe I should just say nothing, block her on everything and move on.  So, would I be the a-hole for telling her?"

He told me that I was overreacting and should not be upset cause a young “man” my age shouldn’t worry about it.   My friend and I never ever had any feelings for each other because I’m mostly into romantic relationships with this one guy at school. She and I became upset by this when we talked later.

There is a four block section of the boulevard that is a school zone, where the speed limit drops from 35 to 20mph, in proximity to the schools. There are large school zone signs with blinking yellow lights at the start on both sides and large end school zone signs at the end of this section. There are also multiple cross walks. There are no stop signs or traffic lights. However we are required to stop for pedestrians in a cross walk in my state. There are many kids walking along the side and using the cross walks during the morning and afternoon.   Every day when I get to the school zone, if the lights are flashing, I slow down to 20mph. No one else does. I get tailgated, honked at, flipped off, people whip around me and then break check me, some people even throw trash at me.

When we got back to our hotel from a long day at the parks, I was thrilled to see there was one parking spot left in the small lot on our side of the hotel. As I started to pull in, I got halfway into the spot and  I was greeted by two women standing in the spot having a conversation who started telling me I couldn't park there because they were saving it. I proceeded to tell them that's not how it works and they proceeded to tell me how their family members were moving their car around from the further parking lot to this one which was closer. I said it did not matter and that they needed to get out of my way. After a couple minutes of standing there I said they needed to move or I would call security. They called security themselves and so we waited a few more minutes for them to get there. We then both told our sides of the story to security during which he asked them where their family member was as it had now been some time and they were still not there. They then admitted that the family member was across the street at a Walgreens and not just simply moving their car. After that revelation, the security guard had no choice but to let me have the spot. I never got out of my car or aggressive with the ladies, even though they were not very pleasant. The reason I am asking AITA is the security guard made me feel like the asshole for not just driving away. He never apologized for the other guests doing that and was making comments to the other guests making it seems like he would find ways to make it up to them. I'm hindsight I probably should have just driven away to show my kids that you don't always have to win and you can just be the bigger person, but I still don't feel like I am the asshole."

The dog is a very good sweet girl who usually listens well, I brush her outside almost daily and she goes every 8-12 weeks for a de-shedding bath, brush and blow out, but she is a husky and they shed a lot. My son had a massive meltdown because the dog was on ""his couch"". To be clear there are 2 living room areas on the main floor, one I've set up for all 5 children as a gaming/play room. He demanded I keep the dog off ""his furniture"" or clean the couch every time the dog goes on it. I do clean it everyday and I try not to let the dog go on the furniture but the couch in question is at the front window so when I go out that's where the dog chooses to watch for me to return. So in return I told him his options were to set up his own space in the partiality finished basement or move out. He yelled and threw a fit saying I was kicking him out and once he leaves I will never see him again. Then spat out that I was choosing my dog over my own child.

Regardless of whether it's actively interrupting my workout, it always makes me feel uncomfortable.

The obvious solution is to just go by myself, but she keeps asking if we can go together.   This definitely is not a ""seeking opportunities for connection because it's lacking in other areas"" type of thing. We spend a ton of time together, both at home and on dates/other activities, and our relationship is great. It's just this one particular situation that bothers me."

This left me to work alone in my department, and management stated multiple times that there were no plans to backfill Jake’s position. With me now working by myself, I brought up the question, “Could I have Jake’s old schedule?” The first time I asked this, management literally laughed in my face, saying that I’m too valuable to not have on weekends.   I worked by myself with my original Thursday-Monday schedule and the workload was not working out being alone. I collected evidence as to why my current schedule didn’t work with the daily tasks I had throughout the week and how a M-F made more sense. Management even agreed that my workload with my current schedule seemed overwhelming. About 2 weeks after that meeting, management came to me with a new schedule… Wednesday-Sunday 10-6. I asked why I am being forced to work the weekends. The answer was that it makes more sense for business to keep me on the weekend in case the front desk may need assistance and that I am supposed to be a “Jack of all trades” and help out wherever needed. I brought up Jake’s old schedule and they simply said that was a pre-arrangement that should have never happened, that they never liked his schedule. He was very successful in the position for nearly 2 years with that schedule but okay.   I tried to fight back that these schedules they were offering were not working. Their solution? To try and merge me with a separate department. They were so uncomfortable with me having weekends off…they thought it was better to merge separate departments with different responsibilities. I legitimately just want a M-F schedule so it makes my work load easier and manageable. My management keeps finding ways to keep me on weekends “just in case” they need help. Am I the asshole?"

Since then we have been speaking almost daily either by text or call he refuses to return to aa but I convinced to sign up for a local recovery service and he starts with them soon,however I’m finding talking to him less and less helpful to my own recovery,we used to talk about wanting to get better and more positive topics but now I frequently get messages from him showing pictures of Alcohol and drugs he’s brought.I didint mind at first because I understand how difficult recovery is and I’ve had many lapses myself plus he always seemed remorseful the next day and said he wanted to stop.Recently though his messages and calls about the drink and drugs he’s been using have become almost daily often telling me how cheap the Alcohol he brought is and how the drugs he is taking is “good shit” I try to steer the conversation back to recovery which is sometimes successful,but more often then not he goes into drunken rambles about nothing or about how aa is not good  and full of hypocrites.  Though this has not significantly effected my recovery yet I do find it quite draining I try to stay positive about things as much as possible because I know if I get into negative headspace I’ll be back on the drink.So I’ve started replying less and less I know I should just confront and tell him not to send pictures and videos of substances but as I’m early in recovery I do not want to come off condescending or rude.I’m hoping the recovery service I helped him sign up for helps him and we go back to having more constructive chats but until then I’m not sure what else I can do for him.Am I being a bad friend for not doing more or I am doubt the right thing for myself."

I (35F) have two kids (6y/o son and 5 y/o daughter) with my wife (30F). We recently (6 months ago) moved into a new neighbourhood, with a big garden and extra-friendly neighbours, much to my wife's request.   About two weeks ago, when I came home I noticed there were three kids in our house. They were about the same age as our kids and my wife told me they were our neighbours' kids, and that they'd met our kids when they were playing out in the snow. I brushed it off and didn't think much of it, especially since my wife told me it was pretty common for kids in this area to come over to their friends' house.  Three days ago, I noticed my wife was extremely down. I asked her what happened and she said the neighbors had given her a call and said that their kids were no longer allowed to come into our house. I don't know what their problem is, but I was like that's what they want for their kids so we should respect that.  My wife got mad at me and said if the neighbour's kids were to ask her to come in, she couldn't tell them to stay out. She's a kind person and that would be the opposite of what she'd do. I said maybe kids could go out to play together but she insisted that it is too cold for that.  I told her that we should still respect our neighbour's wishes or we could go have a face to face conversation with them. My wife simply said she can't leave those kids outside if they showed up. She called me heartless for even suggesting it.  So am I really in the wrong here? They're kids and they're neighbours their house is literally on the same street as ours."

Two years ago he begged for a dog. I've never been a fan of dogs but it was never at the fault of the dog either. It was because of my family. My mom was your ""let's have 8 dogs that keep popping out puppies and never clean up after them"" type of person. Therefore I grew up resenting dogs, their smells and their presence. I was bullied a lot because of how I smelt due to how many dogs we had. BUT now that I'm older and away from my mom and her dogs, I actually do like dogs. Some more than others of course (like my SILs dog is a fucking gem and I love her to bits and I would trade her with my husband's dog in a heart beat if my husband or SIL allowed it). That sounds mean but I'm just being honest. So anyways, my husband gets his dog. I tried endlessly to train her. Professional trainers included. She actually was given a certificate of achievement and taken out of training back 6 ot 7 months ago. At that point I was like 8 months pregnant.   Now one thing that I am completely against is the dog being on the bed. She can be on all the rest of the furniture (sofas, recliners, etc). Just not on the bed. She knows this. She NEVER tried to get on the bed until we had the baby. At that point she would whine while standing with her paws on the side of the bed  and I thought she was being curious about the baby but that's 100% not the case at all. It was jealousy. Resource guarding. We got her checked back in to training following her jumping up on the bed continuously following that and forcing her way in-between my husband and the baby, where she proceeded to push the baby with her paws and snuggle in to my husband while whining and eyeing my kid. It's ONLY when it comes to my husband. She does the same thing whenever he is holding the baby. She loses her fucking mind whining and trying to jump on him. It's dangerous so we got her back in to training (3 months ago).  Well I went to the store yesterday and left the baby with my husband. When I got home the baby was in his crib and the dog was up on the bed snuggling up with my husband, while peeking over him and eye balling the crib, whining (the crib is attached to our bed). I immediately lost my shit and screamed at him to get the dog off the fucking bed. I then accused him of deliberately enabling the dogs dangerous behavior, which the trainers and vets have already started is resource guarding and is a very big issue. He retorted with ""she's probably fucking acting like this because she wants more attention since she **hardly** gets it now that the baby is here"". To say that's utter bullshit is an understatement. If anything since we had the baby the dog is constantly on my husband's lap now and is never alone. I told him if he kept wanting to pull this shit than I can take the baby and go to a safe environment so he can give the dog all the attention she wants. He says I'm an AH for ""neglecting the dogs emotional needs"". AITA?"

If I couldn’t find a free version of the textbook online somewhere, I’d find a site selling cheap PDF copies online- it generally took a while to find the copies but it saved me quite a bit of money.  I always look online for free/cheap versions before my classes start. If I can’t find some, I’ll generally start the course and decide if I really need to buy the expensive version. (We’ve all been there- buying a textbook you don’t really use). In one of my classes, I initially couldn’t find any free or cheap pdf copies, I had looked online for a while. If I remember correctly the actual version was pretty expensive (150$ range) but it may have been less (110$ range). At first it seemed like I could get away relatively ok without using a textbook. About 2-3 weeks after the class started however, I realized it would be a better idea to just get one. I did the same thing, looked online, wasn’t having any luck. Then I found a version for about 40$. I bought it and went on my way. After thinking about it a little more, and realizing how hard it is in general to find those PDF versions, I thought to offer a cheap alternative with the rest of the class. I decided to send an email to everyone and sell copies of the version I bought for 5$. I thought this was a win-win; fellow students would get an ultra cheap version, I would off set my costs, and I didn’t feel like I was extorting anyone because 5$ is literally the price of a coffee. No one was going to be getting rich, and obviously other students can look for their own version aka no one is forced to buy anything. I would have appreciated the option to buy a cheap version if I was struggling to find my own. So I send this email, two people buy the textbook, then I get this really angry email about how it’s awful of me to be profiting off students who are already struggling and how I should be ashamed of myself. I nicely answered it and explained that I bought my version and wasn’t like “getting rich” off of broke students. I honestly don’t really get why the writer was so offended… It’s a 5$ textbook, which is ridiculously cheap, classes had been going on for over 3 weeks which is a long time semester wise, and also you have free will? 4 days later someone sends a link in the same email thread to a free version online. Now I feel like a pos… so AITA?"

But yesterday we were at his parent's place already so I thought ok then we can drive back with two cars and today he could just use the second car. He and his parents were like no that doesn't make sense at all, but I'm thinking regarding gas it wouldn't make no difference and timewise it would be beneficial for me. Afterwards my boyfriend told me that it really hurts him and I just don't want to be nice to him.  And for me it just feels off that not wanting to drive him equals not wanting to be nice. Is this logic adding up? Because thinking about it then yes with not driving him I'm deciding to not helping him out. But I just feel that it's not fair to say that I just don't want to be nice to him, since it's also not like I'm just deciding not to drive him and leave him alone, but I'm also thinking of a way that works for both of us."

Using a throwaway here.   This afternoon I came to visit my aunt and uncle for the first time in a few years. They have a corgi/lab mix who is about 7 years old. The last time I was here she was a puppy so that’s how long it’s been since I visited.   When I came in the house I saw how overweight she is. This dog is at least 40lbs overweight. She struggles to stand up, can’t go up and down their small steps to get outside and has to be given a ramp when she wants to go out.   I know they love her dearly, but part of loving an animal is keeping them at a healthy weight. This girl is clearly uncomfortable.   So I watched them feed her a peanut butter cookie, pepperoni, a beef jerky, leftovers from dinner, and then a plate of chicken mixed with her dog food.   When we were sitting in the family room, I said “don’t you guys think she could lose some weight?” And my aunt laughed and said “oh no, she’s just fat and happy.” I tried to point out how uncomfortable she is and my aunt got snippy and said “you don’t even have a dog.” This pissed me off a little so I go “it makes you a terrible dog owner not to take your pet’s health seriously. You’re killing her with food.” And they got mad and said I needed to mind my business. Maybe they are right, I guess, but the dog can’t speak for herself.   AITA?"

So I work at a place with a locker room, which is a sort of separate room from the break room, the only thing separating it is a door though. We work in a large department (30ish people working each day) where everyone takes their lunch at the same time, 1:00-1:45. I typically finish my food 10 minutes early to ensure I have enough time to take care of me, use the bathroom, reapply deodorant, wash my face, refill my water, and put my food away if there’s any left.    So its 1:35, and I go to the locker room to do the things listed above. It’s my routine. But the door is locked. I go to my managers and ask if there’s a reason for this, and they said that there’s no reason why the door is locked. So I return to the locker room and knock on the door. No answer. I knock again, a bit louder but not too much to disturb my other coworkers trying to finish their break. Still no answer. I’m annoyed, thinking someone accidentally locked it on their way out, but I go to my manager to ask them to unlock it because I still have time to do my routine and don’t want to take up work time to do it. The manager needs to finish something up, so it’ll be a few. Great. I go to sit down in the break room, and a few minutes later the manager comes out with their keys and unlocks the door.    Apparently Bill(30(?)M) was in the locked locker room on the phone the whole time for a teledoc appointment. I didn’t hear him because the breakroom was pretty loud. He was pissed at me for interrupting his appointment with my knocking and for getting the manager because “he was almost finished if I would’ve just given him a minute”. My manager just dipped after this comment, which I don’t blame them for. I said that he didn’t have a right to deny access to the entire team because he doesn’t know how to schedule his doctor appointments outside of work. I was pissed, because I could just come in, grabbed my bag, and given him his space while finishing my routine in the bathroom, but he didn’t even let me know there was anyone in there.    Anyways, I vented to my other coworker Lisa about this and she said that I was in the wrong for not being more respectful of his use of his break, and that full time workers don’t have as much availability to schedule doctors appointments as part timers like me do. She also said he probably thought he would have the full 45 to take his call, instead of being interrupted early, which I didn’t think about tbh.   I’m not sure if I was in the wrong though, AITA?"

This issue is about my daughter, Allie (26F).  She is very upset with me because I am going to allow my niece, Victoria (29F) to hold her wedding at my beach home (rental property). This is a rather large home and it has a pool and private beach access, which is the main selling feature of the home as a venue. I do vacation rentals and event rentals in the home.   I want to add that I am not a wealthy person and this property is used as a source of income so I will explain how I purchased it because it is relevant.  My father was not a good man. He was especially terrible to my sister, Carol (57F), and my mom (deceased). He was okay with my brother (55M) and me for some reason. Well, it would turn out that my father had money, we are not sure where it all came from but when he died, he left it all to me.  He explicitly left my sister who has had ongoing addiction issues and my brother because he is gay (Another story). I decided to purchase the home and set up a business. My sister and brother are not involved but they have free access to the home when it is not in use and I use some of the profits to help my sister and will send my brother a check yearly.  So to the issue, Allie was supposed to get married in May but her fiancé called off the wedding in November and she is devastated (I really do feel for her).  She was going to use the home and we were even doing some renovations to get it ready. Victoria got engaged in December and last week Victoria called and asked if she would be able to use the home in September and I said of course. When I talked to my daughter last night I mentioned this and she flipped out.    I was really shocked at her reaction but she said I am rubbing salt in the wound by allowing her cousin to steal her wedding venue. She went on and on about how she should be the first wedding there (she isn’t, there is one the week before her now-canceled wedding).  She said she will not attend because she will be suffering the whole time knowing it should have been her.   My niece has had a tough life due to her mother’s issues and I know providing her with a venue would allow her to have a wedding she would not otherwise be able to afford, which I tried to explain to Allie.  She said I am picking my niece over her and I pointed out that I would have let my niece use it even if Allie got married there. She said it wouldn’t have been a problem if her wedding wasn’t canceled. But I should have compassion for her the way I do for my niece.  The way I see it is that my siblings and I should have equally inherited from our father. I chose not to alter the estate because I didn’t trust my sister with all that money but her daughter should benefit from the money the same way my daughter can. I try to be as generous as possible with her and her brother but maybe I am going too far."

So I decide to get another pair, totalling to seven birds. Then my old pair bred again and had three more chicks. Two died from being runts. So back down to eight. Then I buy two more finches for the sake of having more variety. I also bought two finches of a different species as they are known to foster chicks/care for sick birds.  But the summer heat gave them all mites. I bought the treatment and luckily they all survived. Then winter rolls around and they all get dangerously cold, one even almost dying. Bringing them inside in not an option. So, AITA for buying 12 birds, being under preapred?  Should add: I'm still dumb, but a year older (14). I know so much now and know my mistakes. Crazy how kuch I people can learn in a year."

To avoid bias I’m leaving out the name of the game and the streamer.    I watch footage of games often to see if I’d like to buy them. I ended up greatly enjoying the playthrough in question both for the game itself and the streamers presentation of it, so I watched the full playthrough. After watching the game I realized that while I thought the story was great, the gameplay itself was nothing special. Just a shooter, and seemed very tedious at times, and that was with the streamer editing the amount of time he was stuck in certain places out. So I had nothing to gain from buying it, and decided I wouldn’t.

My husband we will call B has a son from a previous relationship we will call J Jays mother (30f) we will call SB has given me hell since the beginning. I understand momma bear has got to protect and see what female is around her son but this is not the case. SB has tried to ruin my relationship from telling B to leave me and she will knock of child support to you were suppose to wait for me after we got married. SB is big for getting into Bs head causing him to not think clearing ( I know not an excuse) but with time through all of SBs bullshit we have managed to except each other and go on raising J well recently J and B got home from a basketball game and B hit me with a you need to sit down for this I sat down and B proceeded to tell J if he told me his moms news. Right then and there I knew and my heart sank. I got irritated and started hollering just tell me B then told me SB and her husband are expecting and a reacted a way I shouldn’t have and cursed and walked away crying infront of J. I understand everything is scrambled everywhere but it’s honestly a long story to tell and I am fairly new at Reddit I hear stories all the time and figured I’d ask here I never told my husband how I really felt but it has put me in a deep depression because I feel like that woman has put me through hell and is now rubbing in my face she’s expecting knowing I’m having a hard time convincing.

Friendship ruined due to boyfriend,"Now granted I myself know the answer to this question already, I may be wrong but i definitely do not think I’m the asshole here.   People in this story: Me F22 my friend we’ll call Sally F 25 &amp; her boyfriend Gary M 25  Some backstory: I met Gary middle school. Gary has always been a troubled person, very angry. Got worse growing up. Been on probation since 18, any charge you can think of. I met Sally before the pandemic &amp; we became close. Gary &amp; Sally get in a relationship. Being Sally’s friend I watched Gary be blatantly the worst partner in every aspect.   What happened: Alcohol was a big factor in a lot of things between Gary &amp; Sally. This night included. Our group went to the bar &amp; it was a shitshow to say the least. Leaving the bar drinks at a mutual friends was the plan. Sally was talking about things she didn’t know were true &amp; weren’t her business &amp; Gary got upset with her. This was a common habit of hers. Gary got mad. Sally getting upset as Gary got more angry she ask that she &amp; I leave &amp; go to my house knowing my house is a safe place for my friends.  Before we left the Sally took Gary’s truck keys knowing it would make him mad. At my house Sally begs me to call 911 if Gary shows, I assure I will. He does very angry, &amp; Sally will not give him his keys &amp; he calls 911 on Sally FIRST. My mom comes to the door &amp; asks him to leave, he won’t &amp; Gary headbutts my glass door shatters it &amp; runs away. Sally screams to call 911 &amp; I do. I got the incident on video &amp; sent it to a few close friends. The end.    Moving forward: Sally is now upset with me for calling 911 because Gary is on probation &amp; they have a baby &amp; she doesn’t want him to get in more trouble &amp; go to jail. She’s telling me I don’t understand &amp; that we should of “thought about it” before calling the police. I reminded her that Gary called first before he even did what he did to my door &amp; that 911 would have been coming regardless &amp; it’s not my fault he’s an idiot for 1. Calling the cops when he’s drunk &amp; on probation or 2. Him putting his head through my door because i definitely didn’t ask for it. Sally removes me on everything &amp; begins to tell people that I’m making her situation about me &amp; that I’m not a good friend &amp; she’s mad I sent people the video. Now, should I have sent it around? Maybe not but I dont believe I’m wrong because no one was hurt &amp; MY property was what was damaged. But I just have a hard time seeing how I’m a bad friend for tying to keep her safe from a situation we both know is bad. &amp; I wasn’t trying to make her situation my own by showing people a video of Gary being the person he always has been.   SO… AITA for trying to be a good friend?"

He was the one to move in to my place. Everything went fine, we both took care of housework, chores and our 3 now shared pets - my dog and his two cats.  We met through a video game and both consider ourselves to be gamers of sorts. He brought his own PC with him but resorted to selling it shortly after the move as he needed some money for a surprise bill that came in - we're both unable to work for the time being, due to mental health issues and such. I adviced against selling the PC, telling him it would be something that he'd regret because we can't afford to get a new one for a replacement with high-end GPUs and other expensive components that his old PC had. He was adamant in his decision and at the end of the day there was nothing I could do: his stuff is his stuff and he can do with it as he wishes.  It took him a couple of weeks to then start gaming on my PC, which was okay to me as I now obviously considered the PC a shared one. However he would start spending less time with me and hanging out more on Discord with his online friends. Again, this was fine by me since the new WoW expansion had just come out. I was happy to see him have fun, even if it meant that I couldn't play my games as often.  However, me giving him the green light to use the PC led to him ignoring me for almost all day and spending 95% of his time online. The only time that I get to talk to him is in the morning before he turns on the PC. He ignores housework and chores even when I ask him to do something, anything, around the house. A good example of this is that I asked him to fill the dishwasher a week ago: lo' and behold, the dishes are still scattered all over the kitchen counters.  It's pretty much been all on me to take care of cooking, laundry, dishes, the pets and everything else for over a month now and honestly at this point I'm starting to feel more and more like a 1950's burnt out housewife than a modern day fiancée. He even asks me to bring him his meds as he's gaming because there's always something going on and he can't leave the keyboard.  I really want to tell him to direct more of his time and attention on real life and me, his fiancée, rather than on friends and gaming. However I'm not sure if that's a jerkish thing to ask for since he doesn't have that many friends to spend time with in the first place, and he seems really happy playing his game - which has to be paid for by month to play, or something.  He's neurodivergent like myself and I can understand getting hyperfocused but I'm also tired of keeping up the household on my own and feeling like a butler of sorts.  Would I be the asshole?"

This issue is about my daughter, Allie (26F).  She is very upset with me because I am going to allow my niece, Victoria (29F) to hold her wedding at my beach home (rental property). This is a rather large home and it has a pool and private beach access, which is the main selling feature of the home as a venue. I do vacation rentals and event rentals in the home.   I want to add that I am not a wealthy person and this property is used as a source of income so I will explain how I purchased it because it is relevant.  My father was not a good man. He was especially terrible to my sister, Carol (57F), and my mom (deceased). He was okay with my brother (55M) and me for some reason. Well, it would turn out that my father had money, we are not sure where it all came from but when he died, he left it all to me.  He explicitly left my sister who has had ongoing addiction issues and my brother because he is gay (Another story). I decided to purchase the home and set up a business. My sister and brother are not involved but they have free access to the home when it is not in use and I use some of the profits to help my sister and will send my brother a check yearly.  So to the issue, Allie was supposed to get married in May but her fiancé called off the wedding in November and she is devastated (I really do feel for her).  She was going to use the home and we were even doing some renovations to get it ready. Victoria got engaged in December and last week Victoria called and asked if she would be able to use the home in September and I said of course. When I talked to my daughter last night I mentioned this and she flipped out.    I was really shocked at her reaction but she said I am rubbing salt in the wound by allowing her cousin to steal her wedding venue. She went on and on about how she should be the first wedding there (she isn’t, there is one the week before her now-canceled wedding).  She said she will not attend because she will be suffering the whole time knowing it should have been her.   My niece has had a tough life due to her mother’s issues and I know providing her with a venue would allow her to have a wedding she would not otherwise be able to afford, which I tried to explain to Allie.  She said I am picking my niece over her and I pointed out that I would have let my niece use it even if Allie got married there. She said it wouldn’t have been a problem if her wedding wasn’t canceled. But I should have compassion for her the way I do for my niece.  The way I see it is that my siblings and I should have equally inherited from our father. I chose not to alter the estate because I didn’t trust my sister with all that money but her daughter should benefit from the money the same way my daughter can. I try to be as generous as possible with her and her brother but maybe I am going too far."

Basically after the love bombing phase she started doing it again and finally I had it about 2 weeks ago, broke things off calmly and now we arrive at my dilemma. She says if I take my name off of the home loan she’ll have to refinance with the current high interest rates, but I need my own place as I’m very uncomfortable being around her atp.

Immediately started dating his current girlfriend and moves in with her. She too has kids and they call him ""stepdad"" now. Again they've ONLY BEEN DATING 1.5 YEARS.  Now suddenly he wants to get married again and doesn't even want to get a prenup because ""they have a verbal agreement"" and she's ""a good woman because she brings him lunch to work"".

I'm not going to lie and say I'm perfect either, I get into hobbies, spend a lot of my credit, pay it off, rinse and repeat.   My mother wants to buy a new home which she says is to be for me whenever she passes away. She just paid off a home that was supposed to be a 30 Year loan, and got it within 15, she got $80K by selling it off. (Mind you we haven't lived in that house for about 90% of my life due to us moving out of state, that home was in a completely different state far away from us.) So shes got the $80K and wants to get a new house with it; the new house is worth $290K, and her credit is bad.   She asked if I could get the loan under my name since I have better credit than her and that she would promise to get this paid. AS MUCH as i want to trust my mom here and know that she's capable of keeping a promise; she's 58, if anything happens, like her getting hurt on the job. then i can't pay that myself. I'm not making enough to pay for everything if anything happens. Her plan to combat against this is to have people rent out the home we're purchasing by renting certain parts of the home to rent. I asked her who would be living in these 3 rooms. She could only give me 1 name and exclaimed that ""anyone would want to live here for $900 rent"", then i said ""True, but no one wants to live in a garage?"" She goes ballistic and tells me that i don't have the vision. I told her I'm being realistic and added on by saying ""Look, you're 58, you can't pay off the house in 10 years, you'll be 68 and likely retired, I'll be stuck with a giant house that'll be foreclosed"" She is once again angered when I'm telling her about the real circumstances that can happen. I asked, ""Ok, so how many people right now, are willing to rent"" She says that she has 3 people for 3 rooms. I pushed her on it and asked ""Can I get the names for said 3 people?"" She could only give me 1 and provided only the race of the other 2 renters with no name. I pushed again and asked ""Ok, not the race, the names of these 2 people?"" She responds with a ""Huh, what did you say?"" And that told me everything. (Not to poison the well here, but after repeating it 3 times and her not being able to provide me a quick enough answer to a name for these individuals aside from the first name was super sus to me.) She then got mad at me and told me that it ""doesn't matter, anyone would want to rent here"" I asked her if she lied to me and she wasn't able to admit it. I pushed her again, and then she admitted to lying to me about there being 2 other people who were interested.  I'm trying to plan out my budget so that I can find a place to rent, lowest i could find is $700-1000 a month and try to pay off my debt while I do it, but i feel like it makes the most sense in the long run; also I already tried seeing if i could live with friends to no avail."

I'm Alexi. I'm 15, and whether my name gives it away or not I'm a biological male (but I identify as genderfluid). Alexi isn't my birth name. This is all important info BTW.

We are really in love, and I see no reason to hide something like that, so I told my family (except the aforementioned grandparents) as soon as we got together.  So make a long story short, my grandparents were round my house yesterday. I was out buying bread and on the phone with N and was out for maybe 30 minutes.  So I get off the phone, go inside, and the following conversation ensues (Gp is grandpa, Gm is grandma, D is dad, A is me):  *enter Alexi through the front door, grandparents and dad are sat in the living room*  D: Hey Bud, where you been?  A: ayy sorry dad I was talking to N  D: nah its alri- *cutoff*  Gp: Who's N?  A: *without thinking* My boyfriend.  *dad, grandpa and grandma pause*  Gm: so....you're one of them gays then?  A: *laughing* ""one if them gays""...sure  Gp: its not funny (deadname)  (I have told them both to call me Alexi several times, so I kinda lost my cool here)  A: my name is Alexi jackass, and whats the problem with me being gay hmm?  Gp and Gm: it's a sin!  *dad leaves the room*  A: so is laziness, but neither of you has worked since you were 30, so don't talk to me about sin.

My husband and I have been married for 10 years and we won custody of his 16yr old son (G) 4 years ago. When we first got G, it was rough. He hadn't have any type of relationship with my husband for years because his mother made it difficult. They lived in a small town and the mother's boyfriend used to be an authority figure, it ruined my husband, a lot of unfounded accusations and harassment. He moved a few states away and that was when we met. I'm not perfect and we helped each other with our issues. He worked hard to stay in G's life. When I say G was rough, I mean he was rough. He has not showered in weeks, his teeth was decayed, he was malnourished, and he hated us. A lot of CPS calls, attorneys and law enforcement involvement and we finally got him. We worked with a lot of professionals, got him therapy, got him back to school and now i can proudly say he an amazing young man. But now I'm the one struggling.  I love my husband, he is an amazing partner, a great dad, but sometimes I feel unheard. I have told him before, I do not mind being a step parent but I do not think I can be a full on parent. I told him when we were working on getting custody that I will help out in everything and everyway I can but I'm a step parent, the kid would be his responsibility. When we got G, things were okay at first, he did everything for him and after our family therapy sessions, I took on more roles. I became his guardian at school, everything pertaining to him became my responsibility, taking him to school, taking him to checkups, appointments, baseball game, cooking his favorite food, making sure his laundry is done, he has everything he needs, when he is struggling I'm there. I even changed careers to make more money so we could afford better things for him, better insurance. When he gets bad dreams I get up and make sure he feels safe, when he is sick, I'm the one taking care of him. I would take him to ""adventures"" on weekends. I slowly became the parent and my husband took a step back. G would have an anxiety attack and crying his eyes out, I will be the one comforting him for hours. When I call for my husband he would just tell him, he doesn't need me, you are the mom this is your forte. G is emotional and so are you so this is your field. He needs a mother's comfort right now not a dad. He is there for the fun stuff, games, food nights, going out but not for the mental health, emotional situations.  I talk to my husband all the time. I tell him all the time that I'm struggling. but all i get is that ""You are a parent. this is what it is being a parent."" I'm struggling.   I want to take a step back.

I went to a concert in DC with a buddy at a rather inconvenient location, transportation-wise. We got off at the metro station and had to hop on a school bus specifically for the event. After a few hours of music and fun, it was time to leave. As we walked out, ushers were telling everyone to ""go down the hill and wait for the bus"".  We went down the hill in a large crowd and sat around for about two hours. The bus never came, and slowly people were trickling away, I supposed catching other rides or something ,and we didn't want to leave and miss the bus, having assumed it had already taken a load of people and maybe got caught getting back in traffic.  It was nearly 1AM and I was starting a new job the next day, and I needed to get home, so we decided to finally trickle away down the street until we find a gas station with a LONG ASS LINE for the bus. Apparently we needed to go down the hill, then take a right and go down the street.   So there we were, middle of somewhere in DC, with me as the last person in a giant line for the bus to get to the subway. The subway stop running at midnight and I'm not sure what to do. I hear a noise and turn around, and the bus driver stops the bus right in front of me. Everyone turns and rushes forward as the driver opens the door and yells ""Everyone STOP!"" and points a finger at me, ""I saw HIM first in line, so he's on first.""  I don't know how the driver wasn't aware I was the back of the line considering we were mostly facing that direction, and I assumed there was only one bus driver.  Dilemma:  The *right* thing would have been to tell the driver that the line started at the other end. But I wanted to get home, and I didn't want to get absolutely destroy by tired, angry concert goers if I'd corrected the driver and royally pissed them off. So I kept my mouth shut, hopped on the bus, caught the subway before it closed, and went home while completely screwing over everyone who was at the actual front of the line to wait and wait and likely miss the subway home."

For some background, my family is Chinese, and my mom's side especially favors boys over girls. My grandma babysat me a good amount during my childhood, but I remember \_not\_ being the golden grandchild among my cousins, and my mom was also treated as less than her siblings. Still, my mom tried a lot to occasionally visit my grandma, take her out to lunch, etc. and really valued things like family get togethers.  My mom passed away 4 years ago, it was the worst week of my life. It was sudden and a lot of that time was spent seeing her sick in the ICU. My dad's relationship with my grandma is not good (because of how she treated both my mom and dad in the past) , and was further strained by stress  of being forced into payments for the funeral/tombstone by her family, when we knew this isn't what my mom would've wanted. A moment that I clearly remember is a few days after my mom passed, I met with my grandma for lunch. It felt like she was trying to coerce me to convince my dad into paying for everything. I started crying from being overwhelmed, and she asked me, ""It's been three days, why are you still crying?"" That really stuck with me, though I don't think she knows how badly that affected me.  Pre-pandemic, I still occasionally met up with her to visit my mom's grave out of what felt like obligation. It's hard to describe how I feel towards her, but conversations generally feel uncomfortable because I don't speak great Chinese, she nags or criticizes me a lot, and is nosy. I don't feel like myself when I'm talking to her, I play up a different persona often to appease her. I get intense anxiety seeing her name pop up when she's trying to call me and really dread talking to her. She's given me shit for how I do things, and for not calling/visiting her. I get that maybe her style of communicating is just ""tough love"", but regardless, I'd rather just not talk to her and I want to live my life without her checking up on me and pressuring me to spend time with her. Our communication slowed a lot during COVID though, and I actually haven't spoken to her in a year since I never initiate reaching out.  Bringing us to today - it's lunar new year. There's a family gathering on my mom's side that's happening tomorrow. I'm not going, because I don't care for my mom's relatives and the politics game they play. Grandma's tried to call me twice. I have so many ill feelings towards my family and the thought of interacting with them stresses me out. But I wonder if I'm being selfish for not ""trying"" with them.  I let one of my relatives know to communicate to her that I won't be there. Tbh I would much rather just be NC with all of them, like my dad. I'm not interested in repairing whatever this is either. But I get the feeling she does care for me, so I'm trapped between feeling guilty for being LC/NC but also stressing about the idea of talking to her. WIBTA if I kept this up?"

A few weeks ago she asked me to drive the kid to and from school one day. I agreed to even though I ended up being late for work and had to use my lunch break to pick the kid up. It was okay with me because it was a one time thing.  HOWEVER, since that one favor she has asked me no less than a dozen times for drives and continues to even though I've tried to make it pretty clear that I can't be doing that all the time and have said no 10/12 times.  I'm not just being a jerk, I am a very busy person. My workplace is understaffed leaving me to work every day and double shifts several days a week, we have a hobby farm with lots of animals that need tending to, many pets inside the house, firewood that needs to be split and stacked daily, my husband works 14 hour days 7 days a week and is rarely home, etc. I'm spread pretty thin already and barely ever have more than 30 minutes to unwind before bed.  Today she called me a bunch of times and then texted me telling me she needed a drive at 6:30am. I live 30 minutes outside of town, as does she, but in opposite directions. So that's at least 2 hours of driving. I already have to get up at 6am to have enough time to do my morning chores, exercise and have enough time to make it to work for 8am. So essentially she is asking me to get up at 4am on a day I have a day shift and an evening shift.  I told her my work schedule and she asked me yet again. This time she was begging me, telling me she would buy me coffee and breakfast and pay for gas. She told me she is staying at her daughter's house tonight and needs to be at her own house in the morning.  I am pretty irritated at this point. I'm pretty sure she planned to stay at her daughter's house (even though she has no vehicle and no way to get home when she needs to) because she just assumed I would drive her in the morning. She has literally no backup plan.  I finally stopped trying to drop hints and flat out told her there is no possible way I can drive her. She again started begging. I said there is no way. And now she's mad at me."

My partner and I both agreed we would have a small wedding (it will only be us two and the two required witnesses) and (after suggestions from family) to have a small party the following weekend for family and friends to celebrate the occasion with us. Nothing fancy. We want to avoid the stereotypical drama and hassle and all-around rush of the average wedding day, and to not spend several thousands of pounds on it.   My partner and I have of course been talking about such a thing since we got engaged and we had mentioned a venue we both liked, though only through conversation between ourselves.   My sibling and their partner have recently begun to plan their wedding for 2025 (bearing in mind they got engaged a month ago), and similarly this month my partner and I booked our wedding (for this year) and went to book the venue. We already have our rings.       This is where the issue arises – the venue we want to book for a small family party is the same venue they have booked for their 2025 wedding.       Now, my main reasons behind choosing this venue are:  \- It’s in the local area and I don’t drive,  \- It’s good value for money,  \- It has good parking (half of my family are elderly or disabled or live relatively far away)  \- It's one of the few suitable venues that have overnight rooms that myself and my partner wanted to book,  \- It's one of the only suitable venues that don’t have general public drinking and eating in (we want a quiet, closed-off family gathering),  \- It’s one of the only suitable places still available as most are now booked for Christmas parties (we are saying our vows in early December)  To my genuine surprise, my sibling had a meltdown and threatened to cancel their wedding, and my sibling’s partner messaged me ‘kicking off’ in a family group chat (though never mentioned this concern to me directly, or before the outburst), there’s now drama and stress emanating from most close family members, and so on.   I have simply said we will just cancel our party and not have one at all. My partner and I are happy to just say our vows and be wed, but pressure/suggestions from family initially made us think that having a small family get-together would be nice for all.   So…   **AITA** for wanting the same venue for my 2023 wedding afterparty as my sibling is having for their 2025 wedding?   Note - I asked myself ""what would I do if it was the other way around"" and genuinely I would not be bothered in the slightest if they had their wedding first and used a venue we wanted to use, too. especially if it was 2-3 years prior. I'm baffled because we have been historically a very close-knit family and have always been able to rely on one another within reason."

She informed me that Daughter had had three odd but short  episodes where she was shaking (arms and legs). She also said not to worry or rush off to the doctor, just see what happens. I was more than a little upset that no one had called me when it happened the first time. Later that day,  it happened again, so I called her doctor. On his recommendation, I took her to the local children’s hospital. While there, it happened again and the doctor said that it appeared to have been a seizure. He set up a referral to a neurologist.   My daughter has not been back to school since then. They were on winter break for three weeks and Daughter just recently “settled down” with the seizures and random sicknesses.   I told my husband I wasn’t sure if I felt comfortable sending her back to school because they didn’t call me or an ambulance or anything. He said that it wasn’t a big deal because she is only away from home for three hours, three days a week. He also said I was being a shitty helicopter mom for keeping her from something that did appear to be helping because I was afraid. He very well may be right and I’m just too upset that I wasn’t told the first time she had a seizure until three hours later. I’m just having a hard time entrusting Daughter to them again. I don’t know.   So, AITA for being a helicopter mom?"

Her intention is to go to college next year, which is fine with me although I believe she could get into university if she wanted to.  She specifically wants to attend a particular school because her best friend will be going there as well for an RMT (massage) program.  Together, we went through all the courses they offer and I recommended the Nursing or Occupational Therapist  programs  because jobs are available and they pay well. She wants to enroll in the Esthetician program.  I don't understand much about that industry so I did some research.  The Jobs that are available all pay minimum wage and turnover seems especially high with most graduates only lasting 1-2years in the profession.  I haven't discussed my findings with my daughter yet but I talked to my wife about it and mentioned that I was disappointed in her choice of program  because I feel she could set higher goals than do nails and makeup for minimum wage.  My wife got very upset with me, saying I am an AH for thinking its a poor decision and she supports my daughters decision because that's what she wants.

So one day I said to my boyfriend, without really thinking much of it ""oh what if we tell your sister to move in with us so she can help us pay for the stuff that we can't pay for at the moment"". Then the girl was in the apartment not even two weeks later.   The months go by and everything is fine, but then the girl starts to bring her girlfriend over every weekend and sometimes also on weekdays.   During that time my mental health was screwed and I also began to seek more of God.  So imagine this: you're trying to read the Bible or you're having an anxiety attack about to pick up a knife and kill yourself, and in the background, you hear two girls having sex with moans and screams straight out of an adult movie, how would you feel?   I always told my boyfriend to tell her to please remember that she doesn't live alone and that the walls are very thin.  But she kept on doing them things.   A few months go by and even as I tried ""not to mind"" I couldn't, and my depressed brain wasn't helping either. So one day I kinda got tired of the disrespect and I told my boyfriend to talk to her to see if she could move back in with her mother.    That's where the show started!  She went to her mom to say that I hated her for being ""gay.""  And the situation was no longer about respect, but about me being ""homophobic.""  The mother, said unforgivable things to me, saying that I was judging her daughter and that the Bible it says not to judge.  She also told me that no matter what I do I will always be in sin.  In all of this, the girl never came directly to me to talk to me, she always went to her mother, and her mother never came to me either, but to my boyfriend to tell him what the girl was saying.    In the end, the girl left the apartment in a bad way saying that ""she would not accept that I treat her and her girlfriend that way.""  I tried to send a message directly to her explaining that I was not judging her, and that I was going through a mental and spiritual process.  And she ignored the message for several days and then she wrote to me saying ""she was looking for the right words"", just to tell me to f off and that neither I nor my boyfriend ever speak to her again.  I wanted to leave it like that but weeks passed and I felt so guilty for causing that problem with my boyfriend and her sister, and I decided to apologize to her, thinking that she was going to ignore me. But no, she sent me a tremendous text, that even made me shed some tears, telling me that I put her and ""her family in a difficult situation"" and that ""she'll forgive me not because of me but for her sake"" and of course that she thought she made it clear for me and my boyfriend to never to speak to her again. So? Was I the asshole? I feel like I should've kept my feelings secret."

I didn't think much of it since i knew she'd drop him soon due to their friendship being trough social media, but she started getting closer to him to the point of liking him.    Of course, since we're so close, she sent some of my drawings and audios to him, which accidentally made him start calling me a weeb (and other harmful, racist insults towards me and my family) whenever i was mentioned in a conversation between them. Two days ago, i sent him back a jokeful audio of me insulting him back (nothing racially offensive, or anything)  and he went crazy with almost 60 text messages insulting me. My best friend got mad and sent him a message telling him to stop seriously, but, to my surprise, when he said it was a ""joke"" my friend inmediately forgave him and started calling him cute and childish for being ""mad"" like that. I admit it, i got pissed off by her reaction, but i decided to not act too childish and move on.   However, whenever we're together at school, talking or just less than two meters from eachother she starts talking about him non-stop. Thats when i got truly mad. I told her getting mad at me and calling him cute was unfair. Finally, i told her to block him and learn that if he did that to me, she shouldn't excuse his actions and act so immature just because of having the attention of an older guy.

I never tip less than 5 bucks even if my bill is like 4 dollars. And I always try to tip about 25-30% for larger orders. Its a knife fight out there I get it. Recently I went to a restaurant and the parking was designed in such a way that you drive up to an unmanned ticket dispenser, you park oh your own, and when you leave, you pay online using a number on the ticket, and then you scan the ticket in an unmanned machine to leave. I was the only human being involved in any of this. When inputting the payment info it asked me how much gratuity I wanted to leave. There wasn't even any option for no tip. I had to type on 0.00 in the tip portion. It felt to me like it was a cynical tactic by a company that wanted to take advantage of tipping culture without investing on any employees. But when I told some friends and coworkers about it they all said I should have left a tip. So AITA for not leaving a tip?

Megan lives with me and attends university, she is currently in her first year of obtaining a master's.   Recently, Jenna's husband lost his job and they cannot afford rent on Jenna's disability. Jenna asked my parents if they could move home, I overheard the conversation while visiting my mom and offered for Jenna to move in with me since my parents home is small and in a small town with few job options. Jenna happily agreed and said they would move in at the end of this month since their landlord is allowing them to break the lease since they've been good tenants for 7 years.   Now the way my house is set up is important. I have a three floor home, the upstairs is completely renovated into a mil suite. It has a small kitchen, a bedroom, a smaller bedroom, a small living room and a bathroom with a tub. My first floor is irrelevant. However my basement has a bar, family room, a bedroom and then a huge room with a small bedroom and small bathroom with a standing shower in it. The basement is completely finished. The huge room is probably 1k sq feet. We were going to turn this room into a home gym so it has nice flooring with thick padding underneath. The small room bedroom attached can fit a full size bed but not a queen.  With that said Megan and her dog live in the upstairs room. She does not use the kitchen for anything, I cook all her meals for her since she busy with school. So when I told her Jenna was moving in I said she was going to get moved to the basement room since Jenna would use the kitchen and the division of the two rooms would allow her and her husband some level of normalcy.   Megan flipped out and said that what I was expecting is wrong since she has lived there longer and she is tired of everyone catering to Jenna all the time. She doesn't want to be in a nasty basement with bugs and not have carpet. She didn't feel like moving anything and wanted to take baths (we still have a bath on the first floor she could use). I told her my husband would move the large objects and I'll help her pack everything.  Herr strong emotional reaction is making me feel like i would be an asshole if I made her move. My husband is very much on it's our house and it's our decision. Jenna has no clue what room she is getting so she probably won't be disappointed either way but I feel like logically the basement makes more sense for Megan, especially because she can take the dog for a walk easier this way.

Mary was trilled for us, she had a close relationship with John, and remained best friends with me.   John is very intelligent, and a bit competitive in nature, so he naturally went into an intense career field. Unfortunately he turned towards alcoholism to cope with an intense job. He started seeing a therapist who helped him identify his triggers, he drank less, and then he quit therapy think he was fixed. He started drinking more again after awhile. He did the “find a therapist, control his drinking, quit therapy” process 4 times over 5 years. Each time he’d make promises and agreements. We had 2 kids along the way, the first before I realised how serious the drinking problem was, and the second after he agreed to quit completely and get fully sober. He went back on that promise and said he wanted to be in control of his drinking and only have 1-2 drinks a week.   He never got completely sober. He’d flake out on promises to the kids and me, he’d go out with friends who encouraged him to drink and have 2-3 drinks and then start buying bottles of vodka and gin again. After the 3rd time he quit therapy I gave him an ultimatum, get sober or I was leaving him and taking the kids. I followed through with it.  Mary and I stayed best friends after college but John asked me to keep his drinking from his sister the first time around and didn’t want her to think he had a problem. He was my husband so I agreed if he worked on staying sober.

Mary blamed me for the divorce and wanted to end our friendship so I told her the truth: that I loved him and still do but I wasn’t willing to spend the rest of my life and ruin my kids childhood setting ourselves up for disappointment over and over again when he wouldn’t stay in therapy or stay sober.   Mary was horrified after I told her about everything. She got very emotional when I admitted to her how many times I let myself get excited for plans her brother made with me or the kids only to be flaked on when her brother poured himself a drink after work.

My father’s work had been disrupted due to COVID, doesn’t earn much anymore. My mother has a humble but stable job earning a bit above the US national average. They live in a HCOL area but are moving to a LCOL area in a few months.   I went to college with a massive financial aid. My parents contributed 20k in total and also offered to pay for a one-year graduate program (25k). Right after college and grad school, I worked an entry level job in my field and split my brother’s private high school tuition with my parents (20k from me). My parents claimed that the public school I had gone to deteriorated and insisted on private school. I contributed so my brother would be in the best position to get into a good school with financial aid. I also didn’t pursue some further personal education so that I can ensure I have enough money to pay it forward to my brother (including a couple other reasons).  Since starting therapy during COVID, I have learned that my parents (especially my mother) have narcissistic, toxic, gaslighting tendencies. My parents refuse to accept my new outlook on life and have said unhinged things to me and my fiancé. I don’t associated much with my parents nowadays.

My brother has asked if I can contribute to his college tuition, citing my father’s less work, my parents’ reduced income, and that I have a better paying job today. I feel immense guilt, since my parents have contributed to my university costs. But I am riddled with anxiety financially. I told my brother that I have: an old car that needs repairs soon or be replaced, a wedding to pay for (my fiancé and I are paying for the majority ourselves), I have my own house to take care of, I have some recent physical health issues, my fiancé and I are considering starting a family of our own.   While my parents current income is lower than when I went to college, they have some retirement investments (extra properties, etc.) they have made. Apparently there are investments for me as well. I have told my brother that my parents should liquidate anything in my name and that I can sacrifice this for his education. I’m more than happy “pay back my debt” this way and stop being told I owe something.  I am going back and forth emotionally on what to do. It’s not impossible for me to contribute something towards my brother college tuition.

He didn't want the machine anymore he just wanted to tell me off.  I kinda told him to piss off and he stormed away.  I ended up doing a Karen thing and went up to the morning manager and basically told on the guy. I told the manager that guy was cussing me out and being rude because he though I stole his machine. The manger kinda knows me. We talk a bit every once and a while, so I'm on his good side. Basically, the manager said he took note of that and it was kinda left there when I left today.  Am I at fault at all? Do I have the high road if this escalates another day?"

He can't be alone in any room excelt the bathroom, and even then he has 20 minutes or I'm knocking every 30 seconds till he's out.  He isn't allowed to bring his girlfriend at all, having to watch one of them is work enough. He can't hold or talk to my daughter (1) and there have to be at least three other adults in the room if both of them are. We make sure he has a set time to leave before he comes, so he can't linger while everyone else leaves and try to steal anything. He can't ask me or my husband about work or money, since in the past those conversations led to him asking for it.   He never had an issue with alcohol, so he still drinks on occasions, but he can't at my house, I'm worried it will set off a relapse.

We are renters and our landlords pay for snow removal services for us.   So Wednesday evening, we receive a text notification from the snow removal company saying they will dispatch trucks at 2 am. We do not have a garage and parking both our cars in the driveway leaves no space for the plows to clear, so I decided to park my car in the street in front of our house. The city placed a barking ban between 10am and 6pm the following day so I figured as long as I move my car back to the driveway by 10 the next morning, I'll be fine.   9 am the next morning rolls around and I go outside to move my car. My neighbour (M35ish) two houses down is standing in his driveway yelling that I can't park my car there. I apologize, thinking this is some sort of etiquette on this street I wasn't aware of and continue clearing my car. As I'm doing this, my neighbour starts plowing THE STREET and spaying the snow onto me. I at first assume he just didn't see me and brush it off but he then yelled ""I'm gonna blow all this snow onto your driveway!"" as he continue to spray ME. I didn't confront him and went inside to get my partner. While I was in there I saw him hit my parked car with his snowblower (no damage or anything) and then blow snow from the street onto my car I had *just* cleared off.   I went back out to move the car (this time with my partner) and the neighbour sent his wife over to talk to us. She was much more pleasant but kept asking us to move the car (which we were clearly attempting to do). Her husband was ""doing a nice thing"" by plowing the street for everyone but my car was in the way.   I'm torn as to whether I want to reach out to my landlord about this incident because this neighbour in question is supposed to be our ""emergency contact"" so he is clearly good friends/close to our landlord.   I've only ever lived in apartments and don't know if I'm missing some sort of street parking etiquette? The only inconvenience it caused is that there is snow in the spot on the street where my car was parked that the city plow couldn't reach. Was I the asshole for leaving my car out overnight? Are there unspoken rules for parking your car on the street but in front of your own house?"

She was introduced into our friend group and took a liking to my best friend, John (25M). John and Dina took to each other fast and I (26M) was very happy for them.  About a month later, he tells me that Dina has severe depression and is a recovering alcoholic. He asks for my help because I also have severe depression and have alcoholic family members. I ask him if he’s for sure good with being with someone like her. He gets very uncomfortable when I am going through my own episodes and tries to end the convo or talk around it. He assures me he’s ready for it so I tell him what I would need and what he should do/say. No problems yet.  Fast forward a couple weeks of not seeing him and I see on his Facebook page that him, Dina and our close friend Greg (26M) drinking at a bar. The next time we hang out I ask both of them why they’re taking Dina to bars if she’s recovering from alcoholism and they tell me that she drinks less when they’re with her. I argued that they’re only making her problem worse. Dina finds us at the bookstore we were at, Greg texted her what I said, and she ends up screaming at me how I need to stay out of her life.  Another month later John is almost cut out from my life. He won’t hang out with the group anymore. Greg solely hangs out with John and Dina now. When I’m on social media, I see that Greg and Dina hang out a lot without John. They have matching tattoos, go out to bars without John, and even take beach trips without John. John even stopped showing up to college classes all together. Whenever I look at his socials, he is always at a bar 24/7.  He won’t pick up so I decide to go to John’s mom’s house as he still lives with her. Turns out he left late at night and didn’t tell anybody. Just packed up, left and blocked his family members. Through her Instagram I found out where he lives now and confront him. She shows up and ends the convo by literally screaming “AHH!” At the top of her lungs.  Fast forward again two months and I get a call from John. He caught her in bed with a rando she met at the bar. I leave class to go talk with him. He explains that she was so upset that she had to have Greg drive her to her parents’ house in a neighboring city. She sent him many texts saying how he needs to forgive her or her depression will act up again.  I instruct him to call her parents who then saw the horrible/graphic texts and then commit her to a mental facility. She says I ruined her life. John is slowly recovering from the experience. Greg blames me for ruing Dina’s life. My younger brother (24) says I should have minded my own business. Dina, Greg, and my bro have been saying that if I had kept to myself this wouldn’t have happened."

Simon is not the skinniest kid but by no means is he fat or overweight, but he will make jokes about himself, exaggerating his weight greatly. I have been good friends with both Nick and Simon since 9th grade and we are all out of high school right now, so that gives context to the length of time in good friendship. I've never really gotten on Simon's bad side, but as for Nick, he would constantly berate me in a joking way, saying I would never get any girls and stuff of the like. I woudl return the joke and he would get very upset. I learned to take his jokes but never to return them. This year he called me his ""Nonbiological brother that he never wanted but had anyways"".  &amp;#x200B;  The story: This past winter break, I had caught feelings for a girl named Sarah, as well as a case of COVID that was killing my throat. We would text everyday and on Christmas Eve, we had planned to talk, but it was 3pm and she worked from 5pm-11pm, so I decided to ask Nick if I should start a conversation. He then began to ask which girl this was, and I told him it was Sarah. He then began to bring up every girl I had talked with or liked, making a joke out of what was supposed to be a quick question.  Eventually he asked ""Or was it the girl that was Simon in a wig"", to which I texted back ""No every girl I've liked is skinny."" Nick promptly blew up and I defended myself saying it was a light joke, and that Simon had joked worse about himself. Christmas Eve passed without a response.  Christmas Day comes. No Merry Christmas. I refused to wish him a Merry Christmas because I wanted him to start the conversation after he had practically shut down the last one. I recover from COVID. It's now New Year's Eve, so I text a few people, asking how their 2022 was, including Nick. He leaves me on read.  I see this and proceed to lay into him for overreacting and not practicing forgiveness or at least telling me what I did was wrong, letting me apologize. I then tell him I'd rather not lose him as a friend and would love to exit 2022 on good terms. He ignores me until January 5, when he then leaves me on read. I try to call him, but no luck.  I eventually call Simon and explain things, but Simon sees I was only joking, not actually being insulting, and he forgives me. He then talks to Nick, and comes back to me with the following:  1. When Nick called me his nonbiological brother that he never wanted, he meant it in the literal sense 2. Apparently Nick has had unspoken aggressions against me ever since 9th grade but never wanted to voice them 3. Nick had no interest in talking to me or accepting any of my words  So I, very hurt and betrayed, respond, and tell Simon that I have been trying my best to reconcile this, and if it's unreconcilable, I will allow the friendship to dissolve, ONLY IF Nick tells me himself that he doesn't want to be my friend.  It's been a little over a week, and still no word from Nick.  &amp;#x200B;  Who is the jerk?"

Names changed, obviously. Some context, as I know it’s confusing. In our friend group, one couple usually hosts a fair amount of parties throughout the year. Their big party that they throw is Halloween, as it is the wife (Katie)’s favorite holiday. For many years now, me (36F) and my husband (40m) has hosted and thrown a St. Patty’s day party. I am very proud of my Irish heritage, and it has always been a good time.   In 2020, we did not throw a St. Patty’s Day party because 1. I gave birth in February and 2. The world caught on fire. In 2021 and 2022, it still was not very safe (we are in the US). During these years, Katie did not throw a St. Patty’s Day party.   I was very excited that it is safe enough for us to host the party this year, like we have done in the past. I had a fair few issues being a new mom and not really feeling like myself, or that I was anything more than Baby’s Mom. Getting to interact with my friends again like this and hosting was a BIG thing I was looking forward to doing.   The issue? A few weeks ago (the week between Christmas and New Year’s), I got a FB invite to a St. Patty’s Day party that Katie and her husband are hosting. On Saturday March 18th…exactly when I would have hosted (I always do the Saturday closest to the day). I’m not afraid to admit that I actually cried sitting at my desk at work over this. I don’t know if it was intentional or what, but it really made me feel like utter crap. I know it seems silly, but I was looking forward to getting a small piece of myself back by hosting the party. But now I feel like it would be petty, or read wrong if I were to create my event and invite everyone…as it would force people to choose where to go to…and I feel a lot of people will go to Katie’s since she made her event first. I also don’t want to make the invite and purposefully exclude Katie and her husband, as that reads very petty to me. But I’m sitting here WEEKS later, still wanting to do what has become MY tradition, and is known to be my tradition in our group of friends.  So reddit, WIBTA if I still planned my party as it’s my tradition?"

Our family migrated to this place 15 years ago. When I was his age, I faced a lot of fierce verbal/physical bullying due to my weight, facial deformity, birth/language/race of origin. This combined with the fear of arranged marriage, a taunt used by my mother to get me to behave each time I made any sort of mistake, made me make a very weak decision to off myself when I turn 28 when I was 10. Due to that ""plan"", I never fully put effort into anything I did because I didn't see the point. It also didn't help how I was always seemed to be distracted (overtime got soft-diagnosed with ADHD). Obviously I don't have the same intentions anymore, in the past year I actually did put a lot more effort in making something for myself.   Anyway, it's been about 8 months since my brother had been improving his grades and got into an excellent secondary school. Initially they were against my involvement but I fiercely pushed, and overtime they became okay with it. Now they say how they're gonna depend on me completely for the rest of his secondary education. Recently my parents have been going along the lines of ""aww you're doing all the things you missed out on as a kid"" or ""I see that you're ensuring your brother doesn't make the same mistakes you did"". And everytime they talk about him, they always have to say something about me in a pitiful tone which honestly feels so condescending. I don't like how they always feel the need to include me when he should be rightfully getting the attention, but I don't know why it makes me seethe with rage so much. I told them how they're to never include my past whenever talking about them and they've been saying how I made them feel bad. Am I overreacting here, AITA?  TLDR: Parents constantly keep comparing my unfortunate shitty past to my sibling, which not only makes me mentally suffer but also literally rains on his parade. I hate how they ruin each moment so I essentially told them stfu and to never talk about my past when we're talking about how my brother's doing well"

She has a history of going against my wishes because “she’s an adult and can do what she wants”. She had a difficult childhood and has not received any help in dealing with her trauma, so we collectively just put up with her behavior. I have dealt with this by moving away and being low contact, but we do see each other at least once a month so she can spend time with my child (8M). The story: A few weeks ago, she was at my house and found a pregnancy test, and asked me about it. I confirmed that I was very newly pregnant and didn’t want to tell anyone else because it was VERY early. I explicitly asked her not to tell me Dad because I wanted to be there when he found out, and I knew he would immediately tell everyone else he knows. She agreed and said she understood completely. Today, I told her everything was looking good so I’d be comfortable if we told my Dad. The conversation went like this: Mom:”I already told him” Me: *deep breath* “why?” Mom: “It was on the ride home from you house last week, or maybe it was sooner than that, but the point is I waited” Me: “It doesn’t matter that you waited, I explicitly asked you not to.” Mom: “I could have lied and said he didn’t know, at least I told you now” Me:”That doesn’t make it better. And Dad would have told me the truth. You absolutely knew I didn’t want anyone else to know” Mom:”Well I definitely think you should be the one to tell your brother.” Me:……*deep breath*”Do you not understand why I’m upset about this?” Mom: “No” Me:”Have a good day” *click* I. Am. Livid. Not only did she take away that moment with me and my Dad, but she has no understanding of why  that was not Ok or why I would be hurt. Here’s where I may wrong: In a month we are supposed to go away for the weekend with her and my son. I cannot trust her to take him by herself because she gives him things he’s not medically allowed to have and completely ignores me when I try to set boundaries. This was kind of a final straw moment for me and I really do not want to go. I feel like I shouldn’t be as upset because I knew in my heart that she was probably going to tell him because of her pattern of behavior. I’m more upset about the way she reacted after telling me that she had broken my trust. My son has no idea we were planning to go away, and I can take him away another weekend. WIBTA if I cancel?"

I declined because I have had one too many negative experiences with people who said they meant well only to try getting my kids to admit I was kidnapping them, sneak them out to 'safety', and the like. That shit gets exhausting though I understand their intentions are good. She asks why not, where's their mother, what's my daughter's name, what does she look like, giving me this whole shakedown.

Total mood switch I told him, ''yeah, I've been seeing that people make a lot of money like this, and it's just my feet'' and he answered ''well, I'm gonna start selling pictures of my penis then'' I told him it's definitely not the same thing. He then started saying ''wow, I just don't think I like the idea of having a girlfriend porn star''. I was totally taken aback by this and his reaction, honestly I thought he'd find it funny. After that the conversation just turned completely awkward, I told him seriously if it bothered him that much of course I wouldn't do it, his reply ''do whatever you want'' took me a while to get him to actually admit that it would bother him.

I liked the love letters you sent but at some point they all started to sound the same every single time. You always gave me hearts whether they were paper or wood which i rlly didnt like bc i just dont like most handmade things, esp when theyre useless. I thank you for giving me a christmas gift and a birthday (September) gift, but the gifts rlly made me realize that it does not feel like you know me in the slightest. The doughnut cd and jeongyeon pcs were amazing but they were things i explicitly told you about and you couldve just given me them. The pc mat (given cus I knew they were getting a pc) was also good although i dont know exactly whether it was accidentally good bc i just feel like you wanted to get me smth from pusheen. But i just frankly disliked or even hated every single other gift. It felt like u were throwing pasta at a wall and seeing what stuck. You may feel like im overcritical about this but i put a lot of emphasis on someones actions when deciding if im attracted to someone or not and gifts are very important actions to me. I told you on sumone later (after Christmas) that hate handmade gifts but you seemed to just ignore it.   Let me just do the rundown on them: the (self crocheted) bee was nice but not my thing personally, i alr had the bottle, the puzzle was just frankly bad it was unsolveable and it had a generic message and it was handmade, the wooden hearts were just lazy and shouldntve even be considered a gift, the (selfmade) doughnuts were nice but i personally dont like getting food on a holiday except for candy or chocolate but what was really the last drop in the bucket was the my little pony drink. I may sound a little irritated when i talk about this but thats because i rlly was. Just because i like mlp doesnt mean i want a fucking kids drink with a kinder egg surprise toy which wasnt even fucking decent and the drink was shit. U dont have to know me properly to know that i DO NOT want that. Then also that one date u planned. The cat cafe wouldve been good but the cats werent affectionate at all and that mightve been nice if it wasnt my first cat cafe ever and then u also planned to go to a soup thing (we didn't end up going to) with a deaf owner when neither of us can properly speak sign language and i dont even like soup.  Im just pointing out specific things to say that it felt like i was the only one who was actually putting in effort to know the other. I know i share a lot about myself without someone having to ask but that doesnt mean thats all there is to me. Im sure i missed something but i cant think of anything else rn and im sure this is enough already."""

Just let me explain why. This happened a long time ago, and I have felt guilty ever since. Just so I am clear I am in no way ableist. I have mild cerebral palsy and fetal alcohol syndrome. I think I was between the age of 14 and 16 when this happened. I met this guy who was probably in his 60's or 70's at the time. He was in a wheelchair and had pretty severe cerebral palsy. I always seem to attract attention from men who have cerebral palsy because I have it. They always seem to think that automatically makes us perfect for each other. But I do not date someone just because they have the same disability. I have to actually have more in common with someone. This guy whose name I never even learned started following me around, and showing up at the library a lot when I would go there. He seemed nice. But it was also a bit weird that he kept following me. Maybe he did not know I was underage. But I don't know. I looked very young. Even at 16 I looked 12. So when he asked me to be his girlfriend I laughed. I think I laughed because I felt uncomfortable. I felt bad about it. But I ended up just walking away. I didn't say anything because I did not know what to say.  The thing is I do not know if he understood that I was underage. But he was way to old for me. Even though I was underage I still feel like a asshole. So what do you think AITA?"

I’ve made great progress in therapy and met a great man. The only issue is that he’s 24 and in April broke up with his girlfriend of half a decade who he lived with - something I obviously have never experienced. They do not have each other on social media or spend any time together despite ending somewhat amicably and having the same friends. This is the first time I’ve really fell for a guy and I couldn’t pick out a fault besides this - she is still in love with him and texts/instagram dms him every other day romantically - she even has a tijtok where she posts slides shows of them two about what “could’ve been” which he’s done or said nothing about. I’m not a controlling person but he’s willingly shown me the texts and they’re obviously one sided from her (if he’d deleted any the “conversation” wouldn’t make sense). I’ve told him I’m uncomfortable with the situation as we both are almost ready to enter a relationship but he said it’s not an issue as he doesn’t respond. To me this comes across like he still has feelings for her and wants to keep that line of communication open. I was getting wound up about him telling me a funny story including her and I outright said if we end up together and her number, socials etc are not blocked the relationship will be over. He then said if her texts became more frequent and were about our relationship he’d block her. I asked why isn’t she blocked now - it’s not like you have responsibilities together anymore for example a child. He said I wouldn’t understand as I’ve not been in a relationship that serious before and he doesn’t even respond to her as he doesn’t care what she has to say. I struggle setting boundaries due to my BPD but I’m not sure if I’m being insecure or if he does still love her. AITA for telling him to block her? I don’t want to come across controlling as I’m not usually like this."

It was for a death anniversary. I wanted to visit them without my husband. He doesn't particularly like them and they don't like him. I really just wanted to spend quality time with my siblings. After deciding he won't come and I bought my tickets to visit for one week. I decided I wanted to do something fun with my siblings as well not just be depressed. I suggest a Disney park for one of the days.   This is where I might be the AH. I didn't consult with my husband about the Disney park before asking my siblings if they would be interested. My train of thought was that he wouldn't be coming on this trip so for the itinerary he didn't need to be consulted. I let him know when we were looking into going but I didn't ask if he wanted to come.   He is saying he feels like he is purposely being excluded and that makes me an AH. He also mentioned that he really wanted to go to this park. I honestly did know that. He also doesn't like that i take time off of work for people who obviously don't care about me. He also didn't like that I invited one of my friends that lives in Florida to come along to the park.   I feel like this was siblings time and I'm allowed to go to places without him. I also don't think that I have to ask to go to places when he isn't there. Too me that is weird and controlling to ask for permission to go somewhere when you husband isn't around.

Fall 2022 I was a nanny but the kids worked hard to get me fired and literally didn’t listen to a word I said so I needed to find something different. I accepted a part time job at a local coffeeshop. I took a huge pay decrease and went from full time to part time. I only took this knowing I would find a full time job as soon as possible. After paying my bills, I have less than $40 each check. $40 for two weeks. Every other friday is payday at the coffeeshop so I knew today (1/27) that I could fill up my gas tank.   Well today comes and I have an interview 25 miles away (which is fine, I don’t mind a 30 min drive) but for some reason I didn’t get paid from the coffeeshop. I emailed the owner and he didn’t get payroll done in time so now pay day is 1/31. So I have 50 miles on my car to get to the interview and back. 25 miles each way.   I texted my mom and asked her if I could trade cars with her today for my interview and in exchange I would pick my sister up from school (a task we all dread) and she said no because she had a dr appointment. Fair. I told her I would figure it out, maybe doordash in the area after my interview. She says sorry I have no cash or I would give you some money. I get in my car and see that im not at 50 miles but 42. Fuck. I told my mom this and her response is “take the side streets home so you don’t breakdown on the highway.”   My parents use zelle. I’ve had a job since I was 16 and since then I’ve paid for everything on my own. My sister (19) is the same way. But my brother is 17 and doesn’t work or pay for anything. Just yesterday my mom gave him $20 to watch a fight at a restaurant. So at this point, my mom is actively choosing not to help me. It’s not that she can’t zelle me $10 to get home, she doesn’t want to. She knows I have no money and 42 miles in my car to drive 50+ miles.   So my plan was to try to donate plasma after my interview (I got the job and will be working full time!) and use the money in my tank. Well I ran out of gas before I could even make it to CSL plasma. On the way to the interview was a really bad wreck so I had to detour, took an extra 8 miles off. So I had to call my Grandpa to come help me. But my parents havent talked to him in 2017 because he cheated on my grandma. So now my mom is pissed at me for reaching out to him. But what was I supposed to do? I was stranded on the side of the road, 40 minutes away from home and he is the only person I know on that side of town."

I stayed good and didnt do it ,even tho i kinda wanted to, im 19 , turning 20 in november,and i broke..I wanted to do it so much and it got to a point where dads friend was asking me to do it and saying stuff about how good it would be almost every month and i also followed him on instagram where he posted pics about shoots he did, and everytime i saw it i was like ah that could be me.  I told dads friend okay im doing it but dont let dad know , dont tell him and dont post about it.We did the photoshoot last weekend , everything went smoothly except one thing that i will later talk about it was kinda hot to me atleast..  We did the pics, few outfits, simple white background , no brand deal or anything , just for me to try modeling and for him to boost his portfolios , and my portfolio.  (the hot thing:I forgot my fiji , and its a 20 minute train plus 2 min bus drive plus 10 minute walk back home so i wanted to go back for it quickly, i didnt even close the door yet , i quickly went back to the kitchen area , didnt even make any sounds i wanted to be quick cuz if i dont catch my train i have to wait an hour for the next, and as i walk out and quickly walk past the photoshoot set, i see him with his headphones on ,sitting in front of his laptop, putting some creme or idk what it was on his hands , while his pants are already on the floor ,staring at the pics that we did, i went home and ill be honest it turns me on to this second still,thinking about that)  BUT ANYWAYS  When i got back  I told him if he wants to post anything anywhere , block my dad before he does it , and dont send it to him or whatever.  Next week comes by , he messages me that my dad was acting strange, when they hung out (i only see dad in the weekends so i didnt really see anything) , and that hes scared my dad might have seen it.

I just felt like coming home” and she said that I was only gone for 5 hours.. she was very rude for absolutely no reason.  She started going off on how I am so addicted to my phone and I was lazy.

I was screaming, crying, etc. I'm 29(f) and I found out I was pregnant two months ago. I naturally assumed we would keep the baby because we had talked about it in the past but as of 3 weeks ago, my fiance pulled a line of ""Well I don't know if we should go through with this because how will Molly feel?"" Molly is his 2 year old dog who has separation anxiety and won't let me husband out of eye sight without destroying the house trying to get to him. So he was truly all for terminating our pregnancy in favor of his dog, despite us discussing the possibility of kids for 3 years and him always saying that he has ""always wanted kids"". I lost quite a bit of respect that day and have honestly absolutely hated this dog since then. Her behaviors drove me mad before but now I can't even stand to be in the same room as her. And no, it's not just her. It's him too. I've been so stressed about all of this.   Well, I miscarried. I found out 2 days ago and I'm a complete mess over it. I don't want to talk to anyone. I don't want my fiance anywhere near me either. He didn't even like try to comfort me outside of saying ""I'm sorry"" and hugging me for two seconds. So now I just sit in the shower and cry about it because it's the only place I can get away from his and his fucking animal.   Well, today I was laying in bed awake and just staring off. He comes over and tries snuggling up to me and the dog immediately jumped up on the bed and climbed between us whining. He then starts coddling the dog, talking in baby voice and saying ""give momma loves, momma needs the lovin's"". I told him to stop. I told him to stop multiple fucking times. He then said ""babe she just wants to make you feel better"". I flipped out completely. Everything came out where I told him I fucking hated that animal. I hated the fact that he would have chosen that dog over our baby that just died inside me. I hated that he insisted on calling me the dogs mother when IM NOT and I had the chance to be a real mother and now it's gone and I didn't want that fucking dog or him anywhere near me because he's an insensitive prick for not seeing how much this has destroyed me. I was freaking out. I have said all this to him in small intervals already but he never listened apparently. I just left. I've refused to answer any of his calls. I refuse to go back to that house and be near him and the mutt that invades my space. My father seems to think I pushed it too far though, stating that men are incapable of feeling the emotions as deeply as women do. Weird because he seems to feel a whole lot about his dog but not his kid that just died in me. AITA?"

Fiancé’s mom (late 50s, f) is very involved in our lives. Before the fight, she was coming over weekly for dinner, we would visit her on the weekends, and she would occasionally watch the kids when we wanted a night out. For reference, my relationship with future MIL has been rocky. She is moody, racist, and homophobic. I have tried very hard to get past this in recent years for the sake of the kids.   She has been in a “mood” lately, as she typically is this time of year. She’s been crabby to me and the rest of the family but, again, I have let it go. However, I snapped when it started affecting my kids. This built up over time. There were a few incidents where she told my son that he couldn’t play baby dolls with my daughter and said they shouldn’t even be in his toy box. Then, she told him he couldn’t be “princess fiona” when they were playing pretend. And finally, when we were at her house, she yelled at the kids for not eating the crackers she gave them and told them in a really nasty voice to “stop wasting her food.”  I didn’t say anything during these incidents. I tried to just let it roll off my back because in the past, conflict with future MIL has affected my relationship with fiancé. I assured both kids later that they could play however they wanted and not to worry about not finishing their food. But it ate away at me. I felt like I didn’t protect my kids because I kept quiet in the moment. After a week or so I was full of rage and anger towards her. She came over last weekend with my fiancés sister (27f) and brought the kids each a toy. She gave the toys to them and specifically said that Ethan gets the “boy one” and Lily gets the “girl one.” I fucking exploded. Went full mama bear mode. I immediately yelled at her and said, in short, that I’m sick of the gender role bullshit, we don’t think that way in our house and that I’m done with her moodiness. I was not nice about it. Everyone was shocked. She grabbed her shit and ran out the door and I ran after her. In the moment, I don’t know what I was trying to do but I saw fucking red. All of the pent up anger was just pouring out. She got in her car and drove away and I went on a long walk to cool off.   When I got back, my fiancé was fuming that I blew up at his mom, especially in front of the kids. I guess my son started crying when I left and asked if grandma was bad. I fucked up in the way that I handled the situation. I should have pulled her aside and gave it to her privately, not in front of the kids. But it was literally a knee-jerk reaction. I’m not necessarily asking if I’m the asshole for acting the way I did, because I probably am. But AITA for getting as angry as I did over something my fiancé and his sister are calling “trivial”, “not a being deal”, and just “how she is?”"

My department have always had a fractured relationship with Business Development (basically Sales), even before my time.  One of my clients, I'll call Alice (30sMtF) transitioned late last year and changed her name. I updated her name in our database with no issues. A few days later I noticed that we kept Alice's title as Mr (title lives in a completely different section and I completely missed it). I immediately put in a request for it to be changed to Ms, as that's the title I know she uses. All requests go through the CRM manager (57M), part of the Sales team. He hasn't approved the change since last November. Early in the month I followed up with him and received this reply: 'Oh come on! We're so busy. We don't use titles in any communication issued externally anyway. Haven't time for this.'  I showed his reply to my boss (50M) and although he didn't agree with it he told me not to escelate it to HR in order not to mess up relationships even further.  Yesterday we had a virtual sensitivity training. To my surprise, this CRM manager was there as a speaker and had a small section to present... At the end, there was a Q&amp;A. I raised my hand (on Teams) and described the situation above with the client without naming names. I then directed my question to the CRM manager and asked 'Would this be completely inappropriate to refuse changing someone's title in the database in this case?'. We then watched him ummimg and ahhing for the next 5 minutes. We were about 120 of us on the call and there's a good chance many people gathered it was him! It was the only question he received as well, as he had such a small part.  After the meeting I received a call from my boss suggesting I was TA and it didn't help the relationship. I asked him to wear his heart on his sleeve and tell me if he was OK with nothing being done about the issue. He told me that he enjoyed watching him fluster but still didn't like what I did. As far as I'm concerned, it didn't help the difficult relationships but just didn't sit well with me letting this slide completely either.  AITA for asking the CRM manager that question?"

I'm sick of the lack of gratitude I feel he's been showing throughout our relationship and think he is TA for getting upset with me for doing something nice.

To combat this I have now started to learn Japanese. My thinking is that I can find female language learning practice partners to practice with and possibly get together with one, and just meet more Eastern girls through this naturally, e.g. there's also always a lot of Chinese women learning Japanese.  I asked my friend who's fluent in Japanese about some help with learning it and he wanted to know my motivation. When I told him about it he told me that he wouldn't be helping me with that and even called me creepy. I feel I misjudged him because I was thinking he'd support me. Also isn't that the general approach to meet women through a common interest or hobby? Thats what I had always heard.

Both of us were focusing on our careers and wanted that to come before we decided to start a family. We had an agreement that I would work to put her through school and then, once she got her degree, she would return the favor. This went according to plan, I helped her to get where she wanted to be in her education and she got a job working in her field of choice. After a year, she decided that she no longer wanted to do that and would rather be a stay at home spouse.   I had grown and matured by this point and was totally happy with her for doing what she wanted. At this point I was still paying for all of the bills, all the insurance and everything else, so nothing else changed for me, except for now I was going to have to pay for my own school as well. This put some significant strain on me and I still haven't been able to finish, as I have a demanding job and not very much time to devote to my studies.   About a year ago, my wife decided to get a part time seasonal freelance job in the design field. I told her that was great, but that she would have to save money to pay taxes at the end of the season. She didn't have any obligations, as I pay for everything, so this shouldn't have been an issue for her. This job made her realize that her true desire was to go into design so she wanted to go back to school, which she expected me to pay for again, which I reluctantly agreed to do.   The past three months have been pretty miserable for me because of this decision. I'm paying tuition for two people, all the bills and working full time and to top it off the past three months my wife has been hounding me about getting her pregnant. I literally cannot save money that would be necessary to create a stable environment for a child and I have no time to be a father. I have asked her if she plans to use her degree to help with financials in the future and she replied that she planned to start her own business, but not something that would take too much time away from motherhood.   I don't know if this situation is sustainable in the long term. The tipping point for me has been this tax season, where it turns out ""we"" owe the IRS thousands of dollars for her freelance work and when I asked her for it she shows me her accounts are at zero.

I'd normally be fine with this but I'd been using that guitar for years and was hoping to keep it around for nostalgic pleasure (I hope I used that phrase correctly). Maybe I'm just being petty, but I really didn't want to give it away. Also, I (more realistically, my mum) had given one of my old guitars away to someone else, so, at this point, I felt like I was just being used like a charity shop. I finished my guitar practice and told my mum that I wanted to keep the guitar for previously mentioned reasons. She didn't seem to understand what I was on about and thought it was cruel to keep a guitar from an 11 year old girl.

I didn't say anything at first, hoping it was a one-time deal, but she recently admitted she's fully smoking again and bought a bunch of cigarettes.  I'm disappointed she started a nasty habit that in the past she had been so happy about giving up.

I stayed good and didnt do it ,even tho i kinda wanted to, im 19 , turning 20 in november,and i broke..I wanted to do it so much and it got to a point where dads friend was asking me to do it and saying stuff about how good it would be almost every month and i also followed him on instagram where he posted pics about shoots he did, and everytime i saw it i was like ah that could be me.  I told dads friend okay im doing it but dont let dad know , dont tell him and dont post about it.We did the photoshoot last weekend , everything went smoothly except one thing that i will later talk about it was kinda hot to me atleast..  We did the pics, few outfits, simple white background , no brand deal or anything , just for me to try modeling and for him to boost his portfolios , and my portfolio.  (the hot thing:I forgot my fiji , and its a 20 minute train plus 2 min bus drive plus 10 minute walk back home so i wanted to go back for it quickly, i didnt even close the door yet , i quickly went back to the kitchen area , didnt even make any sounds i wanted to be quick cuz if i dont catch my train i have to wait an hour for the next, and as i walk out and quickly walk past the photoshoot set, i see him with his headphones on ,sitting in front of his laptop, putting some creme or idk what it was on his hands , while his pants are already on the floor ,staring at the pics that we did, i went home and ill be honest it turns me on to this second still,thinking about that)  BUT ANYWAYS  When i got back  I told him if he wants to post anything anywhere , block my dad before he does it , and dont send it to him or whatever.  Next week comes by , he messages me that my dad was acting strange, when they hung out (i only see dad in the weekends so i didnt really see anything) , and that hes scared my dad might have seen it.

Everyone was initially on board but no plans were made then my parents announced that they’d now booked a trip to Australia for later in the year so are now saving up for that instead.

Unfortunately shortly after he took up the new job his mental health took a major hit &amp; he was signed off of work for about 4 months, something that I fully supported- however at the end of this 4month period he decided to go to his (&amp;my) boss of his 2nd job &amp; say that he wasn’t going to be continuing with it as it was causing too much stress &amp; anxiety. Due to this we obviously were down a wage &amp; this coincided with my pay dropping from full pay to stat mat pay leaving us very short financially.   Here’s were I feel like I’m TA - this has meant that any plans for my birthday are now out of the question, nothing. Totally get that my DH mental health is the most important thing but I can’t help but feel salty at the fact that the timing of him quitting his job wasn’t even considered &amp; that nothing had even been planned anyway (I mean it’s not like my birthday was a surprise, it’s the same day every year?!)

[Medium Length],"I spent months recording some music. My partner knows I tinker with making music sometimes. I write too. I do all kinds of things. But I didn't tell anybody I was working on a couple of songs. I don't usually tell people about things I'm working on, for a number of reasons.  1. It sets an expectation. If something happens and I can't finish the project, I have to explain myself when those people ask whatever happened to that thing I was working on.  2. When I tell someone I'm working on something, I often end up experiencing some of those positive feelings you get from actually accomplishing something. In my case, it negatively impacts my forward momentum.  3. Sometimes I want to surprise someone. It can be fun for me and them and it gives them less time to form expectations. Expectations are a lot of baggage to bring with you in any context.  So, I'm on a drive with my partner (we're using her car for this trip, so she is driving) and she asks if I can be the disc jockey for the trip. I'm going through my phone, queuing up music, and I add one of the songs I did.   It plays and it isn't so bad or amateurish that it stands out. And I often play her music she's never heard (I'm always looking for new music). I ask her what she thinks of the song. She says it's not her thing. I'm a little disappointed to hear that (there are those expectations creeping in) but I don't say anything.  A few days later (yesterday), she walks in as I'm fixing a slight problem with the mix on that same song. She puts it together right away and is upset that I didn't tell her it was my song in the car. I say I wanted an unbiased opinion but she's acting like she said it was shit, which she didn't. She only shrugged and said it wasn't her thing. She says she wishes I would have told her beforehand.  Am I the asshole for not telling her, ""Okay this next song is me!"" and then staring at her as it played?"

Leo insisted he knew how to make it in the microwave, so I told him he could knock himself out, but he didn't; when he took it out, he accidentally spilled hot water on Theo and also the macaroni was clearly undercooked and just gross looking. They ended up not eating at all.  I told them to go to the couch and watch TV so I could get some hw done, and guess what. They argued. Again.  This time it was over what TV show to watch. Theo THREW THE REMOTE at Leo's head and he started to cry. I told them they better hand me that remote and guess what Theo does. Instead of handing it to me nicely, he throws it at my head too. I told them that's it, I'm leaving, and they both looked like they didn't believe me.  I texted their Mom what happened and that I wasn't staying and she begged me to at least until she got home. I told her I'm not staying in a place I don't even feel safe at, and left.  The twins mom called my mom, and when she got home she yelled at me and said I made her look bad.

Me and my partner are both in our 30s and planning to get married, so it's serious. I am in regular contact with partner's family, although it's limited mostly to family occasions and polite help when necessary. We get along OK-ish. We've had a number of heated discussions because of our differences. We are (and want to stay) child-free, we're also calm, not outgoing and socially awkward and anxious people. Partner's family is not like that at all and we're both considered weird and different. Typical ""Keeping Up Appearances"" situation.  The problem: a family wedding to which we were both invited, but none of us wanted to go. A big religious ceremony with a huge party afterwards. We both hate weddings! Any family celebrations, where people drink too much, brag all the time, criticize us because we're not like them and force us to have fun while we're literally dying inside and later need 48 hours to get back on our feet again. All family meetings are so fake in our eyes and their only purpose is to show off in front of the others.  Partner complained many times about not having a say about anything in life, about biting one's tongue and going with the flow, just to avoid family drama... Said that they should go to the wedding, but do not want, because they don't approve of many things that happen in the family. I felt the same. As we were the black sheep already, I sad: who cares. I wanted to be a supportive partner, wanted to make my dearest feel like their opinion matters. I asked my partner whether they're not afraid of making the to-be-weds angry, they said it should be fine. They're not close, and I met them just once.  We've let the future couple know, they seemed OK with us not coming. We offered to come visit them after the wedding, and they seemed fond of this idea.  The shit storm was LE-GEN-DA-RY. We've faced backlash from basically the entire family, because it is ""unimaginable"" to not go. Because we've had ""no valid reason to not go"". Because we ""must show we have money to give"". Because tradition is so important here and we ""can't be different"". I couldn't care less about them not liking me, but I now feel so bad for my partner. Never the golden child, now hated even more, and it feels like my fault. Everything would be better (pretty and fake) if I'd made us bite our tongues and suggested that we go no matter what. The newlyweds are ghosting us. Partner says that ""they showed that they true faces"" and seems to shrug it off, but I know there are many unspoken words behind it.  AITA for supporting my partner in being true to one's feelings instead of being wiser and pushing us both to that damned wedding just to avoid the drama?"

We played this soon after we got it and my brother had an ... interesting strategy. I can't remember the actual colors so let's just say that his color to describe was mustard yellow. The first word he used would have been ""egg"" or something. We all placed our pieces either around the yellows or maybe the white/peachish colors.   For his two word description, he would have said something like ""bright sky"", much to our collective confusion. When it turned out that his color was a yellow, we all demanded an explanation. He proceeded to explain that he had decided to say something completely intentionally misleading straight to our faces as the second clue so that we wouldn't get too many points. what the fuck? It would have been one thing if he laughed it off and was like ""oh yeah i cheated sorry"" but he didn't. He insisted that that was allowed and he did nothing wrong. Since then we've argued about it on and off, my parents both think that it's against the spirit of the game. I keep saying that yeah, there isn't a rule against it, but there isn't a rule against swiping everything off the board and throwing a tantrum either! They didn't think they'd have to explain why you shouldn't do that. He is now saying that it's not even against the spirit of the game either, so here I am asking for stranger's opinions.  TL;DR: My brother intentionally gave a completely unrelated clue in a board game where he was supposed to give clues that actually point to the right answer. He doesn't see what's wrong with this."

It’s more of like a heads up thing. I’ve been with my boyfriend for 4 years. It’s a great relationship and I love him with my whole being.

And if I didn’t do that, ofc I would have many texts or calls asking where I am, you know the drill. It’s a safety thing, a respect thing you know? We spend every day and night together so when one person doesn’t come home and the other knows nothing it’s normal to be a little worried? Okay anyways. Anytime he does ANYTHING it’s like he refuses to let me know. Going to the store, going to hang with friends, getting food. He never lets me know. And if he does send me a text it’s nothing more than a few words and he will not respond unless minimal 30 minutes pass, to an hour to even over that. He doesn’t have a job. No kids. No pets. It’s not like he’s doing something super important. Am I just being an overbearing asshole or is it valid that I think more communication should be happening ?"

Mom dealing with BF who doesn't agree with choices," I (31F) have been with my boyfriend (32M) for 7.5 years. I have a son(13) from a different relationship, and a daughter(5) with him. Recently I expressed that I want to go to the gym/dance class 3 evenings a week with my friend (F). I 'm gone for about 2 hours, with the time it takes to drive there/back. He doesn't agree that it's the right thing to do, bc we should be together every night. He complains that sometimes I don't get home from work until 5/5:30 (happens about 8x per month.) I'm a visiting nurse that works 9-5ish. Sometimes I get home earlier, like 3:45/4. I used to do Beachbody workouts at home, but wanted to switch for heavier weights/added benefits. My BF then said he wanted 3 nights a week to ""do whatever he wanted,"" so we agreed that my nights would be M, T, Th and his would be W, F, Sat.   Since my schedule varies, he typically asks what my day looks like. The day after we made the agreement, I let him know what time I would be home and what time I would be heading to the gym. He became pretty quiet - texting one word answers, etc. At home, I could tell that he was upset with me since he avoided eye contact, wasn't speaking to me/short with me. I went to the gym anyway that day and the following, since it was M/T. Now he has been saying that he hates his life, he never gets to do anything bc he is tied to the house and the kids, always working or at home, that I don't spend enough time with them, I'm selfish and only think about myself, etc. I do the entire morning routine with them since he leaves early for work. He gets them off the bus bc I'm working, but I make/cleanup dinner every night, do all the household tasks and take our dogs out 2x/day. I do the bedtime routine unless I ask him to - and often he ""can't"" bc he needs to go to bed.  Adding - I smoke mj, used to be daily when I got home from work, but it makes me anxious in public, so I don't smoke on days that I go to the gym (which is another reason I wanted to switch from at home workouts - because I'd like to quit altogether someday, or at least not be craving it daily.) On W this week, I got home from work late (about 6pm) since someone had an urgent medical need. I smoked when I got home since I wanted to take the edge off the tension - I was getting an attitude from him over text after I told him my visit ran late. He laughed and put ""visit ran late"", like mocking or calling me a liar. I then started making dinner pretty much immediately. My son came in the kitchen, looking for bottled water, and I didn't realize that we had run out. As mentioned before, I get anxious in public if I have smoked, so I told him I couldn't go to the store, to drink juice/milk/tap water instead. He walked out with a cup of juice. My BF started called me a ""scumbag in his book"" because I ""couldn't go to the store because I was HIGH"" - I put that in caps because of the infliction in his voice when he says it.  AITA for wanting to go to the gym 3x a week and smoking mj?"

I’ve never had a great relationship with food, I just don’t enjoy it like so many people do. So eating is more like a chore for me, yet I do my best to eat nutritiously  and to also find things I enjoy.   One thing I do like is French onion soup, at least when I’ve had it a French restaurants. I recently found some at Trader Joe’s and took it out of the fridge today to make it for lunch.  When I removed it from the box, I saw the two servings were packed in little bags - with lil bits inside (seemingly cheese and croutons). Honestly not the most appetizing looking but I was happy to overlook the presentation at this stage.   As I was pattering around the kitchen, my husband came in and we were chatting back and forth. I wasn’t paying full attention to what he was doing, until I realized that he’d picked up one of the bags of soup while remarking how gross it looked. He then proceeded to pretend he was pooping it out and dropped it in the floor.   I was so horrified that he would treat food with such disrespect and also be so ignorant as to how that would put me, or most people if you ask me, off their meal.   I’ve spent a lot of time in economically developing countries, and I’ve witnessed severe poverty which has made me come to treat food with utmost respect- as much as I don’t quite enjoy it myself. I also grew up saying grace before meals and have spent time in numerous spiritual traditions where food is honored and treated as manna from Heaven. I get that not everyone sees it that way, but what he did couldn’t be farther from that.  I yelled at my husband expressing my shock and horror at his immaturity and disrespect for my food, and I said things like “I can’t believe how immature you are”, “Jesus Christ you’re 45 yoa, not a teenager, you need to grow the f@ck up”.  As it stands right now, it doesn’t seem to me like he gets why I’m so shocked and upset. I got the typical blank stare as if I’m way over-reacting.   So AITA for calling him immature for pretending he’s pooped out the food I was preparing to eat?"

My morning classes are 8:30-11:30 Monday-Thursday about a 10-15 minute drive where I live. My job can also be a 5-10 drive.  Time mainly depends on traffic.  The car is under my moms name. But my stepdad told me when I’m 18 (2 months about) he expects me to move out ASAP and this car won’t be a car I can drive anymore. And that it will be going to my brother (16m)   My mom and stepdad had a whole fight over what he said. Because it’s legally my moms car and she can choose. And with my job I’ll be needing the car more even out of highschool. And that my brother hasn’t paid anything for the car since we got it, he either refuses, or the job market doesn’t want him. I’m not sure. His only income is his game tournaments, idk how much he makes from that. Me and him agreed though that besides his game nights, it’ll be a IOU for gas. But he’s also a shit driver (almost crashed the car on his second drive with me) so I drive him wherever usually.  Me and him both waved the road test (aka we just got our probation license right away, no driving test). But I think I was better at driving because when my parents picked me up from work they made me drive home, even when I had my temps. My brother after driving school didn’t drive at all. It’s probably been almost a year now since driving school  I put roughly $20 of gas in it every week, $45 for insurance monthly. And I’m being told while I pay for this car I’ll have to save for my own. My mom did agree to pay for some of a possible new car, but wants me to take out a loan for paying for it. I think I’m just more mad that my brother gets a free car that I put money into whole I’m expected to buy my own   Me and my mom got into a fight over the car repairs (I just can’t idle it atm) and she needed $500 more to repair it. I told her it’s my money, and not my car. Even if she’d said she’ll pay me back I’m not giving it. She called me selfish that I don’t wanna help her poor mom. After that I’ve been staying at my dads more.   I’ve been hoping to have about 4,500 saved for a car, but it’ll probably be around 2,500-3,000. Idk how much my mom will support on buying one (she has bad spending habits and blown 30,000 in four/five months when she was unemployed)  AITA that I have to pay for this car, while expected to save for my own"

The job market here isn’t terrific, my partner just now got a job yesterday, and I’m still looking.  About a month ago, I ended up asking her if we could move in for a couple months if we can’t make ends meet. She said that she wasn’t comfortable with it, but gave me $600 towards our bills instead. (mom is retired and between her and her spouse, they still make six figures with his job, her pension and her social security)  Any time my mom needs help around the house, somebody to take care of the dogs, or literally anything else I’m there. (and it’s been that way most of my adult life)  Last night, my mom called me to ask if I could sit with one of her dogs this morning so she could take the other to the vet.  She usually tears the house up when she’s left alone and she didn’t want to crate her.  She called me about a half hour beforehand to say, I want you to ride along with me to the vet with both dogs, because of a particularly traumatic experience there a few days ago with a nasty dog. She was concerned that she wouldn’t be able to keep him in the backseat and didn’t want to put him in the back of the SUV.  I hit some traffic in town that added a couple minutes onto my drive, and got there at 11:19 instead of 11:15.  The first words out of her mouth were, “that wasn’t very helpful.”  I asked what she meant, and she told me, I told you you to be here at 11:15 and now the dogs are freaking out because one is in the car and one is inside. (also, I’m not sure if my mom has been on time for anything in her entire life.)  We leave, we get to the vet, he gets his blood drawn, and (thankfully) his numbers are normal.  My stepfather couldn’t go because of a doctors appointment, but then shows up at the vet about halfway through the appointment, implying that she just could’ve scheduled this literally any other time today.  We get back, I ask her where she’d like me to put the leashes, and she told me on the table, and that I could head out now.  I said, “well, I love you, momma.”  She says, “(name,) I ask for so little… I ask for so little.” and walks out without saying another word.  I know it would’ve been less stressful for her if I was on time, but I feel like I do more her than most adult children. Also, her saying that she asks for so little makes me feel taken advantage of, and not telling me she loved me back really hurt. AITA??"

I will not be a stay at home mom or change my entire life to take care of the kids. I want to be like a cool aunt. He expressed he did not expect or want that. We came to agree that I would be a mother like person in their life and Co-parent in most cases. But the kids are not my full responsibility and I am not their mother.  All of that is fine and dandy for us. But I have been getting comments and what not from others acting as if that is unreasonable and shitty of me to not totally accept parenting of kids I didn't have.  I have a busy work and social life that I am not willing to abandon that. I am willing to adjust some things to spend time with the kids and do things with them (as I already do). I will pick them up from school, take them to soccer, go to the park, get up in the middle of the night if they are sick, make food, ect. But I am not signing up for being fully responsible.  As a woman people already expect me to be maternal and take on responsibility that they would not expect in a man in my same situation. Parker agrees with me on all of this.  His mother has put a bit more responsibility on me than I would like but we addressed it without further issue.   His sister thinks I should take full responsibility for the kids and thinks I am an asshole for my stance. Parker supports me and my role and told her that.   Aita? Some parents who are friends view it as a red flag that I'm not all in. Others think it's reasonable to express boundaries and expectations and as long as we agree on it.  What does reddit think?

It’s hard to find things to talk about with my family members outside of that stuff. I never EVER talk to my family about fandom stuff or even what show I’m watching because when I was younger my interests were never taken seriously with family. I would be teased relentlessly for liking something “too much.” This has caused difficulties with relationships and friendships because I have such a hard time opening up about that stuff so I have a hard time finding others with common interests.   Recently, I’ve been trying to talk less about work and more about my interests (which is really hard for me) which right now consists of rats because of how much I’ve been bonding with them and researching them, but it’s been met with eye rolls or being told I’m “killing the conversation” or just them clearly not listening and just saying “oh yeah?” after I say something. It hurts and just reinforces the fact that I shouldn’t share my interests with others.  The other night at dinner, I was telling them about how my rat enjoys this blanket I knitted for them and I was met with the usual “oh yeahs” and it’s been a really hard week for me and I just snapped and said, “can’t you guys just pretend to be interested in my life for five minutes?”  Even when I talk about work, they don’t take much interest or I’m told I’m talking down to the guys who are affecting my job performance for not getting their jobs done or doing this or that wrong.

More specifically, his condition is at a point where he can walk a short distance but with crutches, so he is usually in a wheelchair. He does not have any cognitive, intellectual, or learning disabilities, so he attends regular public high school. The only accommodation he has is that all of his classes are on the first floor.   Unfortunately, kids can be cruel and heartless. My son learned the hard way. People belittle him in the hallways if he isn't moving fast enough in his wheelchair for them, and some call him derogatory names. He states that it's mostly other boys who do this and that the girls are a lot more mature and accepting.   Over the summer, I will sometimes take him to work with me. I work as a project supervisor for a residential subdivision. He got to see many of the same workers multiple times as I took him along with me to many homes I supervised. He took a liking to the plumbers, but I think that they're a bad influence on him. One in particular swears...A LOT...I mean he says ""fuck"" at least three times every sentence. Imagine a fat 40-year-old man with a mullet swearing incessantly on the phone in front of myself, my son, and the Mexicans he hires from Home Depot to assist him.  My son has picked up on the extreme swearing habits. His favorite word to use is ""motherfucker."" He's gotten quite a few referrals and even some detentions for using ""extreme profanity"" in front of a group of friends he met this school year. These friends of his don't tell the teachers, rather they often overhear him. Under normal circumstances, I would severely punish any child of mine for this. However, because he is b bullied often due to having cerebral palsy, I basically let it slide. People think that since he has cerebral palsy that it automatically also means he is mentally challenged. This is certainly not the case with my son. The bullying has actually gone down this year compared to the past two ever since he started ""talking blue."" That being said, I have discussed with him that he is not to direct his profanity at any teacher, staff member, or female. He understand this boundary and only swears in front of his ""clique"" of all-male friends.  Sometimes, he talks to his friends on his phone at home, and the swearing is very audible. As mentioned earlier, I don't punish him for his multiple detentions earned for profanity, but my wife and my daughter can't stand it. My daughter says that it's gross even though she understands why I let him get away with it (note: he never swears at his sister or his mother, or directly at me)."

Basically parents drop their kids at the front gate and a staff supervises to make sure that the kids get on campus quickly and keep the flow of traffic moving. If they're not coming to school via car, then they have to enter campus on the other side which is not preferable because there is a lot of traffic and construction.   The system works everyday but Friday when they have this one teacher doing gate supervision. She spends way too much time chatting with people.   I started keeping track of how much time this is adding up and it's a lot. Today, she spent time showing a parent pictures on her phone and talking. I honked and was ignored. I can't let my son out of my car until a staff visually sees him transition from my car and onto campus.  Eventually I got out of my car and asked the mom and teacher how much longer were they going to be? There's like 20 cars behind me and three ahead of me and this only happens when this teacher is doing gate supervision. The mom drove off and the teacher said nothing.   Later today, I got an email from the VP telling me that I yelled at her and the mom and created an unsafe situation by getting out of my car. I corrected that version by saying that the teacher was creating an unsafe situation by creating traffic.   The VP asked me if I yelled or cursed and I said nope. She said that someone said that they recorded me doing so. I told her not to play games with me because she'll lose. Because guess what? I recorded it too.   All of a sudden it's a misunderstanding and I was asked to apologize to the teacher. I said I would after she acknowledged that she was wrong."

She asks me what dates would work for me, I have my own wedding in October, one to go to in August and another in September. So she's trying to plan around my schedule and her family's schedule since we're all long distance from her. Of course you can't make everyone happy. There is four months left for wedding planning, she lets me know that she set her wedding date a week before mine, and the same day my other friend Kara who asked me to be her bridesmaid is having her day.   Vivianna states that she is unsure that she will be able to stand by me because she plans on taking a week long honeymooon right after her reception. So basically she wouldn't be able to be my bridesmaid anymore. I give her a week to think about it as I would love to have her there but she still needed more time. I told her since she's unsure and wants to take her honeymoon that I'll have to kick her out of my party because It's not going to work out. No hard feelings though, I wished she could have been there. She expects me to at hers and leaves me with the choice of either being a bridesmaid at her wedding or Kara's wedding since she picked the same day. I tell Kara and she basically stops talking to me because she had planned her day first and asked me first to be there. I decide to go to Kara's wedding because of that reason and taking into consideration that Vivianna's wedding is in California and the expenses I need to put aside for her wedding is just not going to work out since it was going to be expensive to buy the dress, plane ticket, hotel room, transportation, etc and I needed the money for mine.

We haven't been official for very long but we had a long dating phase and have been friends for 4 years, so our relationship moved quickly. My parents welcomed her with open arms and have been very kind to let her stay here with us.  The car I'm driving is NOT mine. It is my dad's, he bought for work but has been working from home. I've been fortunate that he allows me to use it for school/ leisure, he pays for gas and insurance.  She started an internship this week. I live in the suburbs, but I go to uni in the same city as the internship. Her internship is in downtown. She needs to be there at 8am, with rush hour and distance it can easily take 50-60 minutes or even more if an accident.  The metro is closer to my house than the internship, \~20 min. We've been waking up at 6 am to get ready and take her to the station. We missed her train on Wednesday because we got out of bed late. So I had to drive her to her internship. The drive there was horrible and very annoying. It took nearly two hours to and from my house!  I made her breakfast and got her lunch ready for today. I came back to my room and she asked me if I could just take her to her internship, and that I could say no. So I said no because the drive is horrible and uses lots of gas.  I considered going to the internship but the route was \~55 mins, so I kept driving to the station. We got there and I said ""I love you, have a good day at work"". She says nothing, grabs her things, and slams the door and walks away. I am flabbergasted, upset and annoyed that she did that. She usually texts me when the train leaves, but didn't. I waited a bit to see the train leave, but couldn't see. After about 10 minutes I left.  She sent a barrage of texts saying she was hurt and it doesn't take much to sit and drive. Also sent ""idk if I want to be with you if you're not willing to do this for me"" , etc.   Note: She started working a a grocery store this past fall to help keep busy and make money. I would take her to and from because it was near the uni we went to. I would even take her to work on the days I didn't have school or class. So this idea that I'm not willing to help is just not true. I am just not trying to burn a hole in my dads pocket for gas.  I am furious at this point, I have done so much for her these past 6 months! How could she be saying all these things to me? That I don't help her and she doesn't know if she can do this. I reply calmy to her ""I don't want to talk right now. I won't have a clear head or good things to say."" She responds "" Neither do I. But I at least want to know that you're okay"". I say back to her ""I am. I'm home. Thanks for caring.""  I feel she's being a bit ungrateful and selfish. We've talked a bit, but haven't made progress towards making up. She says I'm not seeing her perspective, but I also feel she's not seeing mine.   AITA?"

I am friends with both the family and my friend and I want the best for them. Plus everytime he gets kicked out he has to stay over at my house, which is becoming more then a monthly event. It's safe to assume if he really gets kicked out he will have to live in my place as well sonce I am the only one who can and will accomodate him.

One of my friends in our apartment building had a bong, and he asked if we could borrow it. While taking rips, he dropped the bowl somehow, and it broke into a few pieces. I immediately told my friend and he promised to replace it. He didn't have the funds right then and there, plus my allowance was a couple of days away. I told her personally that if he didn't replace it, then I would do it with my allowance. She was pretty annoyed by it (justified), but she accepted the answer.

I didn't put too much thought into it, I figured that I had just misplaced these items or eaten them and forgot about it. That same weekend, I was at the friend's apartment, and she left me alone in there to go meet up with another tenant for an exchange. I was looking around and noticed her laundry basket was overflowed. As I stared at the clothes, i noticed a distinctive pair of stretch pants that my mother had purchased for me from a boutique at home. I quickly rummaged through the apartment and found one of my shirts and the variety bag of chips I had from my apartment (they were ripped open a certain way, so I remembered).  I was beyond angry. I had given her a key to my apartment, so I would always have someone who could let me in if I got locked out. (A previous incident happened where my abusive ex literally locked me out for the night and I had to sleep on someone's floor until he would let me in.)

In early July of ‘21, John had fallen and fractured his hip and was hospitalized until the beginning of September when he was moved to rehab. With John unwell, my dad’s arrangements fell to me. Jane never offered to handle it, she just told me that she would help me with whatever I needed but, she couldn’t travel to Vegas. John took his brother’s passing hard as the rehab facility was constantly contacting me about the lack of progress he was making. About the middle of Oct., he had run out of coverage for rehab and was unable to care for himself. The plan was to get him from Vegas and bring him back to our home with my mom and I. With his weakness, it was going to require 2 people. I updated Jane about John and before ever asking for anything she just said she would help me with anything but, she couldn’t go to Vegas. I had to have my fiancé’s sister fly 8 hours on a Saturday to Vegas and fly 8 hours back that same night. The following weekend, I had to fly back out to Vegas alone to pick-up my dads ashes and collect anything important from their house and clean what I could. John’s care was too much for me and my mom so, he had to be moved into a nursing facility. I spent time nearly every other day speaking to attorneys, case managers, doctors, etc. for John. The attorney advised me that he needed the equity from his Vegas home for his care. The realtor estimated it would sell for X(due to lack of care, damage, mess, etc). If I was willing, they could have their team do some work to bring the potential sale price to 1.5-2X. I spoke nearly every other day to their team for a month for the renovations. I entered a contract for a little over 2X Jan. 22’ and days later, John passed away.   I am the executor handling probate and Jane has done nothing. There was a 401k and I provided Jane the info to make her claim. After I saw the medical debt John accrued, I asked to Jane for the whole 401k to cover any expenses I was incurring as it looked like the estate could go bankrupt. She agreed but, had not made the claim. This went on for ~month when I finally had the attorney draw up a paper having Jane forfeit her claim to the 401k. The 401k contact called me to say after 3 months of not hearing back from Jane, she finally had. The contact did not know however, that her call came ~hour after I emailed Jane the 401k forfeit form. Just to be clear, it ONLY applied to the 401k. Jane never brought the 401k money up to me again and neither did I. Months past and working with the attorney, taking the harder paths, we settled most of John’s debt for much less than anticipated. This resulted in more than expected(~a decent one-time annual salary in the US) that will be inherited. John’s will, written 6 years earlier, spelled out 50:50 for Jane and I. He verbally talked with me in the months before passing about revisiting that but, I never deemed him well enough to sign a new will."

To be clear, our guest list includes spouses and serious significant others already (as far as our knowledge goes). Our issue with giving everyone a +1 is we don’t want people bringing random people to the wedding just for the sake of having a +1. We think it makes more sense to only give +1 for serious/long term relationships &amp; spouses. (we would not determine if a relationship is serious. that would be up to the invite to disclose) and that’s assuming someone gets serious before our wedding.   I was thinking maybe non serious +1’s could pay for their plate? But I’m also not sure if that is appropriate."

So I (19f) live with two roommates (19m and 24f), in an apartment under my name. We have lived together a total of 2 months.   Recently my roommate (24f) who I’ll call Beth put up decorations in our shared space. Most of them looked lovely and went with the apartment (modern) well and I told her as such. The other night she added a few new things, I assume it was to make the apartment more homey as we are still adding decor and furniture. But in my opinion it these new decorations looked very out of place. My other roommate (19m) asked about the new decorations and I said Beth had put them up while we were at work and that I don’t like them. I asked if maybe I was thinking too hard about it and he agreed it doesn’t look good. I said I’d just replace them over time with more fitting decor and explained maybe she just wanted to fill empty space.     Fast forward to last night, I’m with my roommate (19m) and his little sister. She asked about the decorations and said “what IS that?” and I said that Beth had put them up. I asked her if they look tacky and she too agreed. I added that “it just doesn’t look right in a modern apartment” and told her my plan to replace them. My other roommate added that looks “like a crack house now”. I don’t think that should’ve been said.     Well Beth heard and came out pissed off and took down one of the decorations. I told her exactly what I had just told my other roommates sister. That it doesn’t look right in this type of apartment. She just gave a defeated “yeah” and went back to her room. I feel bad but was told I shouldn’t because of all the things she pulled.   For context to that Beth is problematic. Short on rent, doesn’t contribute often to groceries, doesn’t take responsibility for her cat tearing up things, damaged my car when I let her borrow it and didn’t own up to it until I said something. Prone to guilt tripping, she’s the type to spin any story into how she can do no wrong. I quite literally had to stop her from hooking up with a junior in highschool. She runs her mouth to friends of mine about me to the point they contact me and ask what’s going on. I constantly regret her moving in. But I think I’m letting my frustrations with that get in the way of me actually hurting her feelings. I don’t know if this is her of getting a taste of her own medicine but on the other hand I was talking shit on her decorations point blank and I think I should apologize.    So AITA?"

I informed them multiple times to pay last month's bill but they ignored. I didn't had money to pay on their behalf so I got fined and had to pay $400.  Fast forward to now we had an LTB hearing this month. Landlord was asking for $8500 in damages and improper notice. He had provided 40-45 evidences none of which included my name. Yet other's were repeatedly mentioned in those. Like the damages they caused in their own rooms and kitchen. I was the only one who gave a proper notice. But since it was a joint lease In fact I was the only who was able to provide evidences for the hearing. None of them put any effort. We were given an option if we want to settle. So we settled at $1200. One of the guy agreed to pay the $1200. LTB said they don't care who pays the money, landlord just wants the money. That's it. Case closed.  Now when that guy asked me money, I told him that he owed me too. He said that we can settle what he owes me later on. I said no, we won't. He won't get the full amount. I asked him all of them ignored my messages? They tried to laugh it away. This pissed me off so much. Since then he has been asking me for money and I'm ignoring his messages. In fact I don't want to pay anything because why the hell was I even dragged in all this?  I had warned them several times of the consequence and they acted tough year back saying that they will fight during the hearing. If I pay him it means I'm paying for his damages? It's not about money. It's about the accountability they never took and I was dragged with it. What should I do? WIBTA for not giving him money."

For a little more context every year we've been dating we have celebrated Valentine's Day on some level, usually I take her to a fancy dinner etc, even during covid I cooked her a nice meal with homemade chocolate strawberries etc.  Fast forward to a week ago and my fiance came to me and asked if I had a problem with her hanging out with a friend on February 14thIt was late and she was tired after work so we never really decided one way or the other.  Cut to last night where she asked again if it was ok for her to go and when she told me the dates again it clicked for me that she was talking about leaving on Valentine's Day. I confirmed that she knew that it was Valentine's Day because maybe she forgot like I did and she said it's not like Valentine's day is a big holiday and it really doesn't matter because we can celebrate it later anyways.  This upset me from my point of view, she is choosing to hang out with a friend who again, she has literally never even hung out with before over spending and anniversary and Valentine's Day with her fiance.   I went quiet after she was done, and even though we were about to go to bed excused myself from the room and slept on the couch Now this morning we've discussed it again and I tried to explain why I left.  Convo Her : We can celebrate whenever and it's her 21st birthday so she's excited.  Me : By that logic you could celebrate her 21st birthday with her whenever... ( Implying she can miss the vineyard and still celebrate with her on the weekend or something )  Her : Well it's her birthday and she wants to do it the 14th.  Me : Well if she insists on having her party on Valentine's day she can't be upset if couples want to spend the day together instead of going, she should pick a different day or at least invite both sides of the couple ( not sure if I mentioned but at no point was I told I was invited to come along even though it's a group thing and the friends boyfriend will be there )  Her : Do you not hear how selfish that sounds that you want her to not celebrate her birthday when she wants to!?  Me : She can have her party wherever she wants, but if she's inviting other people on Valentine's day there's a good chance any couple will have plans or at least want to come together!  I then tried to ask how she would feel if I didn't celebrate her birthday this year to go hangout with a new person I've never hung out with before, and we'd just ""celebrate later""  Her : That's different it's my birthday   Sorry for the long post but PLEASE weigh in here, AITA here?  TLDR : My fiance thinks I'm selfish for wanting to spend Valentine's day (also an anniversary) together instead of her celebrating a ( BRAND NEW ) friends birthday that I wasn't invited to."

We were close coworkers for 6 years, then for the past almost year I have relocated across the country for my spouses job. Joseph, another friend, and I have a text chat for random life stuff and memes that we use every couple of days.  Joseph told us yesterday that he is suspended and possibly fired (decision pending) for sexual harassment. He has been sending sexual/inappropriate memes to at least one female coworker and he showed an example. He said people are overly sensitive and it’s funny, and he’s pissed that they went to HR instead of talking to him.  I’ve tried explaining that harassment isn’t just direct propositioning, or showing nudes. This meme could easily be seen as propositioning too, especially to a coworker if you send it to them individually. He at most has said it probably wasn’t good to send to them but he still acts like this is being done to him unfairly.  I am fed up. This isn't the first time he’s crossed the line (he showed me a pic of his friend in a bra one time and I flipped out saying he had better learn from this and delete it or I will tell her. I didn’t report because I was moving and wanted to give him a chance to change. Clearly not.)  I don’t want him to lose his job but I think this might be the only way to show him. As a last ditch effort I gave him a prompt, almost thinking/writing homework about what this meme would have meant for the other person, and what he learned from the experience.  I am now an educational assistant in elementary and this is not unlike a writing prompt we give 3rd graders. I would never otherwise send an adult something so condescending but I am not ok with his behavior and he is going through life refusing to grow or make long term change.

And when it drops to a certain level you faint so I have a lot less room for it to drop.   Doctors say blood transfusion would prolong his life maybe a few months but he is still going to pass away. My mother who's overcome with grief is insisting I give it anyway, she doesn't care that donating blood makes me pass out and thinks I can deal with the fainting because he's my brother and if I love him I'll do it. If it would save his life I'd suck it up and do it but fainting is super unpleasant and I don't want to do it, mother is saying she'll disown me and never speak to me again if I don't and called me a ""selfish cunt.""

I do know how to dress in slacks and button-ups when the occasion calls for it like having to do the rare meeting at work, weddings, nice restaurants, stuff like that so I own just a couple of nice things. I've been with my girlfriend for little over a year now. I love this woman just how she is and couldn't care less if she's in sweats and baggy shirt, she's still hot to me. A while back she showed up at my place with shopping bags and said that she had a surprise for me. Bags were full of new clothes that are completely opposite from who and what I am. I told her thanks but she should really take them and get her money back because I would hardly ever wear them. She said they were a gift and I could find plenty of reasons to wear them.   Bags have been sitting in my closet close to a month now. This last time she was at my house she saw them still in the closet and got upset that I haven't worn them and asked if I'd start wearing them for her. I told her I'd wear them for appropriate occasions but random everyday wear that she wanted, no, there's no reason for me to get home from a day of work all dirty and get into slacks and a blazer. She suggested that we start going to really nice restaurants for our weekly date night so I'd have reason to wear them, I told her only if she starts pitching in to pay for our dates. Then she hit me with how her ex would dress that way often for her so I told her she had three options: go make-up with her ex and get back with him, I get to change 50% of her wardrobe to stuff I like and she wears it for me, or we just drop the entire topic and she takes the clothes back, and makes due with seeing me dressed like that once a month when I take her someplace really nice and any other special occasions that pop up.  She dropped it but is still pouting days later. My take is that I would never just take it upon myself to buy her a bunch of clothes in a style I know she hates and expect her to wear it half the time just for me, or insist she starts wearing make-up just because I like it, so I didn't think I was wrong to refuse to wear them.

There are a few things, like cleanliness and dishes and stuff that I wish would be better but it's not that big of a deal as l usually will just clean for her because I prefer a tidier house and don’t want her to get mad if I ask her to clean up something. When she moved in a had a dog, a huge but loveable old man that just likes to sleep and eat and would sleep with both of us at night (he essentially ran the house). Unfortunately my Momo passed away a in October and we've both been feeling the loss.   Recently, the loneliness and lack of companionship was starting to get to me so with the advice of my therapist I adopted a new dog for the purpose of it becoming an ESA. A sweet, almost one year old who was surrendered over Christmas — in agreement with H.   Usually he sleeps with me, but the last few nights he's been elsewhere. When I brought this up to my roommate she said very nonchalantly ""oh I wanted him to sleep with me so I grabbed a treat and brought him in! He spent the whole night in my bed!"" I tried not to be upset by it, but since then it's gotten worse. She's even posted online about ""her dog"" with photos of MY baby  After a few nights of her coaxing him into her room I brought it up and let her know that I wasn't comfortable with having him in there due to garbage and the state of her room. She got mad at me. She told me that it wasn't her fault that he liked her better, that pets choose their owners not the other way around. That if he wanted to be with her, then that was that, she wasn't going to deny him the ""pleasure"" of sleeping with her (her words). She even went on to say that if he chose her as his mom then I couldn't stop him from being with her because that was animal abuse and implied that she'd take him if I were to ever move out  So, I moved all of his things into my room (even took the treats and toys she’d taken from the kitchen into her room) and shut the door at night. Only to wake up and find out that she had taken him from my room again. I woke her up by calling him for his walk and she freaked. She said I was inconsiderate for her need of companionship and that if my last dog as allowed to sleep in her room then so should this one. I just decided not to fight back and bundle up my baby and take him on a very long walk which pissed her off enough to post on Instagram about how ""some people just never learned to share in kindergarten.""

She is a PTSD dog so I bring her most places and if I'm going to be there overnight she comes too. I've literally brought her into a museum as an intern.   In my boyfriend's house there are 3 people 3 cats and a dog not including my dog and I.  Bf- 1 cat  John- 1 dog Taylor- 2 cats  My dog is well trained and has only had issues with one big dog that kept stepping on her before she went through service dog training and never had issues with cats. She gets along well with my boyfriend's cat they even cuddle at night and if that cat is around he will defend her from the other cat.   One of Taylor's cats immediately didn't like her and started going after her. She has gotten numerous scratches from his cat and his cat has never been harmed. I've tried playing with his cat to get his energy out, I've pet them both at the same time so he associates her with me petting him. I thought it was getting better until today. It was totally fine they sniffed each other this morning and whenever I see them interacting I keep a close eye on it.   Then, I got up to grab something from the kitchen and she stayed on the couch and he went after her. I grabbed her and picked her up and brought her to the kitchen and cleaned her up because she was bleeding. I pet her and gave her lots of love and then went and pet him to try and pacify him. I was upset, but I understand it's a process. Like an hour later she jumped down towards the water bowl and he went after her again and I pulled her back onto the couch and his other cat came running in and attacked her while I was holding her so I got scratched too.   The cats continued hissing at her and prowling and I threw a pillow in their direction to get them to back off a bit. Then, I told her to stay (which she did) and put them in Taylor's room and let my boyfriend's cat out (my boyfriend's cat can't free feed and Taylor free feeds his cats and gets mad when my boyfriend's cat is out when his door is open)   Taylor then got mad at me for putting his cats in his room because he pays rent here when I don't (not even always true- he has needed help with rent 3 times in 9 months and he has the master room with a private bath. I also do more chores than he does even though I don't live here).   We spend more time here because it's closer to my boyfriend's work and my school than my apartment is. I honestly am feeling bad about my dog and her being in this situation. I hoped I could figure it out, but idk if that's the case anymore.   If anything I feel like TA for continuing to put her in this situation not for Taylor's sake, but for hers."

The kitten lived at my apartment, and I paid the vet bills and most of his food/litter. I am a bit of a doormat and tend to go along with things because I don’t like to rock the boat. Well, they kind of staked a claim to the cat, despite him living with me, and got me to agree to let them take care of him if we were to break up. I now regret agreeing to that, but I was willing to let them take the cat because of that agreement.   Well, due to their living situation, income, and mom (she didn’t like the cat) they can no longer keep the cat, but they won’t return him to me. Instead, they plan to give the cat to their mom’s co-worker. I got pretty upset when they texted me this because they made it out as if I had no say in the situation. When I asked to have him back, they started talking about how neither of us is capable of taking care of a cat, and he needs a stable home with owners who have enough money and time to care for him. Yes, a cat does need those things but I am fully capable of providing them. I have already had several pets that were solely my responsibility, I am in college and working part-time, and I really really love that cat. I guess not being home very much could be a bad thing, but many cat owners have full-time jobs, and that isn’t seen as neglect. I always make sure he has stuff to do while I’m gone and make up for it by giving him extra attention when I am home.   We have been arguing over text for a few days now, but they started ignoring me, and I am afraid they will just give him away anyways. I texted their mom hoping she would talk to ex or give me the cat since he is staying with her at the moment, but she just said to handle it with ex. But I can’t because they are ignoring me. They were pissed that I texted their mom, but I don’t know what else to do because they are just opening my messages, and this is time sensitive.   My friends are all on my side and have suggested going to the police and getting him back that way, but I feel very guilty, and they are saying I'm the asshole because I said they could have the cat, but I said they could take care him, not give him away. Are there any other ways I can get my cat back, and if not, would I be the asshole for taking it to the police if their mom won’t help me?"

She has been wanting to do this for a while now and my room is one of the best deals you can get in my city. The problem is that my friend is very irresponsible and really doesn't want to move out, so I would be backstabbing him in his eyes despite my good intentions.  Lets start with some background. My friend currently has a very bad relationship with his parents. Mother says he doesn't do enough but he says she complains before he even gets the chance to do it. He had to stay the night 5 times these last 3 months since his mother got so angry she threw him out of the house, only to pretend like nothing happened the day after.  Said friend refuses to even send an email to let my landlord know he is interested, despite having gone on and off on wanting the room these last 2 months. He says it is too expensive (despite literually not having to work and still being able to afford the rent + health care from his government allowance) and he would rather safe up for a car and spend money on fun things while he still can. Additionually he is using me as a bad example saying he doesn't want to live in a mess and financial insecurity when he can just live at home. All valid points except that I choose to live like this. It has nothing to do with the room and everyone who has lived in this house has always been able to follow school, pay rent and do fun stuff.  i carefully talked over all the specifics with him. He agrees with me he could pay for the room, but he doesn't trust himself enough to take care of himself and his study in the meantime. Since losing the room would also be a big loss for the friend groups smoking/learning sessions, I offered him to pay 100 euros a month for him taking the room and I offered to help force him to do his homework like they did with me. He still chooses to stay with his parents since it is cheaper and more comfortable.  Long story short, I genuinly believe moving out will be better for the family and my friend, but he won't see it that way. Would I be the asshole if I asked his mom to kick him out?"

She is not anywhere near as well-off as we are, and although we certainly aren't what I would call wealthy, we did decide to go a little bit extra on their wedding gift since we could and felt like she and her fiance could use the help. Nothing crazy, but about $100 more than we usually do. We figured it would be appreciated and for us, it was just skipping a few take-out meals and cooking at home, not going to break the bank.

I said that it had nothing to do with the money - if she had sent us a nice text message or even a piece of paper that at least had our names on it and referenced the gift, I would have been happy. However, damage is done, and now his immediate family thinks that we are snobs.

Im also on SW. I have to be constantly checked on even though I've repeatedly said i wouldnt do anything again. My caretaker is also around 7 months pregnant now. Which I understand means she's not in the best shape herself.  For awhile I've been feeling a bit unsafe with my caretaker, like she just doesnt care about me. There are multiple reasons, but 2 situations I feel I can share.  The first was around 2 weeks ago now. My ear was really hurting, so I texted my caretaker before going to the sink. My ear felt wet so I folded a tissue and just put it in my ear. When I removed it, it was covered in blood. I panicked and immediately told my caretaker before checking my ear again. With a mirror I could see a cut and a bit of something sticking in my ear. I was able to pull it out, it was a piece of plastic, and I decided to treat the cut in my ear. I heard my caretaker walking around outside my room and I thought she was finally coming to check on me and make sure I was okay. But she didn't. It took me around 10 minutes to treat my ear and she never came in. I went out of my room to see her and she was standing less than a foot away from my door looking at her phone. I said hi and she said hi, then she just went back to the couch.  I ended up telling my mother (she pays the caretaker) and she was so mad that she docked her pay for awhile.   The second situation has become more of a normal occurrence. My dad leaves at around 7 am and my caretaker gets here at 7:30. I get medication at 6 am, and then every 6 hours to help with the pain.  Since there are a few sketchy people who've been seen around, I've started double locking the doors, meaning for anyone to get inside I'd have to unlock the door first.  Recently, when my dad goes to work, my caretaker hasn't been coming over. She's stayed home, which means that I miss my 12 pm meditation and don't get any medication until around 1:30 or 2 pm when my dad gets home (My parents, my doctors, and my caretaker have all made it clear I'm not to take medication myself and I must have someone there with me). I once again told my mother about this and she's now looking into finding me a new caretaker.   When they hired her, my parents had a contract with her that said a few things as well as they would prefer she not get pregnant while working for them and that if she did she would be replaced. My mother wasn't made away of the pregnancy until my caretaker was around 4-5 months pregnant simply because my dad doesn't want to go through the process of finding a replacement.  I see my caretakers POV. Pregnancy hasn't been easy on her, I don't blame her for anything. I wasn't trying to get her wages docked.    AITA?"

The thing is, he doesn't really know how to express himself emotionally. So, whenever I'm upset about something I just try not to talk about it because I genuinely don't know if it will upset him or not, because he never tells me if/when he is upset with me or about a situation.  Last night I was just feeling very upset because I had just had a rough day, and I was feeling like in the past few days that he had been withdrawn and not really involved in the conversations we were having. So, after my friend had left my place I decided to call him to just talk to him and see if I was just being overly emotional and irritable. Well, when he answered it was almost like nothing. Just a simple Hi, which from different perspectives is normal, but at that moment all I wanted to hear was a ""hey baby how are you?"" which is our usual banter. We're on the phone for about an hour with small talk about valentines day plans, and seeing my best friend but that was it. I make a lot of our conversation, so whenever I'm upset or whatever the conversation is very little to nothing at all, just silence.  He then asks what's bothering me after I get ready for bed after being on the phone for an hour. I know what's going on and why I'm upset but I'm not sure how to form it into words. So, I stumble with my words for a little bit, when I finally tell him that I fell like over the past few days I have felt that he was not super present and that there has been not really any affection as well. After I said that I hear a ""I knew there was something wrong, I have been trying to figure it out all day. You were being so short."" He never asked if everything was okay, I'm also a college student who takes intense classes. After he said that I knew he was upset, and I immediately felt horrible.

A few days later I had positive c-19 test and it had spread to my mother, brother and husband (all of us are in the higher risk group, only I have been able to take part in a test drug) . We narrowed it down and know that it came from the friend who travelled. Anyways we asked on the group chat asking if they had taken the test. Their response was well I feel better and his family member he lives with went to the Dr and only had a sinus infection. What we were trying to do was ask him to take a test but he does not get social ques. I want to ask them that unless we all get negative tests we can't continue hosting group. AITA? Am I overreacting? PS normally when our friends are sick we skip group. This is our 1st time getting infected and no we did not have special rules during the pandemic. Is it too much to ask and if not how do I make it even more clear without being a witch?"

I agreed with some conditions (eg not reading labels to check for animal products, broth and fish ok, and if he wants to eat meat when he is older it will be his choice). Our son is 3. We also have a 4 month old baby.   We are separating. The separation is very amicable and we are good friends and want to prioritize a good coparenting relationship. I would like to offer my son meat for a few reasons but I definitely don’t want to be an asshole. Here are my reasons for wanting to offer meat:  I am not a vegetarian and would like to be able to make non vegetarian meals without having to cook separate foods for my son.   My family is not vegetarian and it is extra work for them to make vegetarian options/for me to bring something separate for my son.  My son has no preference for eating meat vs not.  I have been responsible for making sure he gets enough iron and it is easier with meat options   WIBTA for going back on our agreement to raise our son as a vegetarian?"

I'm not there very often and last week I came up for the first time in a while. While there he showed me damage to a wall in the kitchen that had clearly been caused by the door handle hitting the wall too hard; the dent was the same shape/size as the handle and plaster was all over the floor from where it had been hit. The last time I was in the apartment it was not there, so it was very clearly either him or a friend he had over. He seemed to find it quite funny and when I commented that I hope the cost of repairs won't come out of our deposit, he said it definitely would. My concern now is that when we get our deposit back at the end of our tenancy, money will be deducted from both of our shares of the deposit (one month's rent) equally despite the damage not being in anyway my fault. WIBTA if I expected him and asked him to pay for the damages, or to return me my share of the deposit that is taken to pay for the damages?

I told him about Val \[F32\] who friendzoned me but then got angry at me for dating after. One evening Jon and I were at a bar and I saw Val there she asked if she could join us, I agreed, everything was fine but Jon was saying how sad he was that he booked this fancy bar and now its going to waste, then he looked up at Val and asked her if she’d be his date instead, she of course agreed.  Then a couple of days later, I met up with Jon, I didn’t bring it up, he did and said they’re just friends nothing happened, anyway he said that he’s organised a big night out with a lot of our mutual friends and then said “sorry man, I’ve invited Val and she REALLY doesn’t want you there, she said it would be awkward, so I can’t invite you” and luckily I already had plans but of course I said “okay, bit weird, you just met her, but fine”   A few days later Val to my surprise invited me to that night, I replied “thank you for the invite but I already have plans, have a good one though”  Anyway, fast forward to that night, I’m at a bar with some friends for a birthday event and then Jon walks in with Val and some others from work, I go over and politely say hello and he said “What are you doing here?” and I said “Well you said you were going somewhere else” he handed his coat out and said “hang this up for me” and I could feel myself getting angry, this guy was my friend a week ago, now he was just being a dick, I asked him if we could talk outside, he laughed and shrugged “er fine?” and I asked him outright “I’m confused, you said Val didn’t want me here, yet she was the one who invited me” and he said “oh yeah? Cool man I’m glad, yeah you can join, I’m sure if you’re nice to people they won’t mind you being here” and I felt even more angry at the audacity of this and I said “so why did you lie then?” and he said “look man, I’ve had a rough day I haven’t got time for this” then his friend Fred \[M25\] rushed over and said to me “look man, val did say not to invite you, he’s being honest” so I rose above it and said “sorry for the misunderstanding, have a good night guys” Fred patted me on the back and said “love you man!” and went back to my group.  Then the other day, Jon asked if we could have a beer and a chat, I went and he said “listen man, you really confronted me the other night and I think you owe me an apology” I felt myself getting annoyed so I calmly replied “I’m not apologizing for telling you how I feel, you were very rude to me” and he almost seemed shocked and then asked if we can still be friends and I said “don’t worry we’re fine” but he’s been telling everyone at work I basically yelled at him, which I didn’t.

We are totally on a level with our wedding planning and I can’t wait to be married to my best friend! The problem is coming from my mother, who will be funding the majority of the wedding and wants to be an active participant in the planning. I love her, she is a brilliant and beautiful woman, but she needs to control everything or she will loose her absolute mind.  We are an interfaith couple—I’m Jewish and he is Catholic—and our religious identities are important to our identities. I suggested we have a private courthouse wedding and then a big reception to keep everyone happy, or at least equally disappointed. My mom really wants a big ceremony though, and she wants our family’s rabbi to officiate.   If we are having a religious ceremony then it is important for my fiancé and his family to at least have some catholic elements in it—a benediction and a reading, which I think would be great and express us as a couple! The problem is my mom has put her foot down and said we can do an interfaith wedding but in the Christian aspects cannot say the word Jesus once or she will be deeply offended.  I think it’s wild to be offended by the name Jesus. I tried to tell her this on a call and she got super defensive and has been talking shit to the rest of my family. Am I the asshole for standing my ground and telling her that an interfaith wedding has to actually be interfaith? How do I appease her and not offend my partner and his family? I just feel like if you are going to totally neuter a religious ceremony I would rather it not be religious at all TBH"

So when me and my GF started seeing each other we would spend night and day together as we were both unemployed at the time it was nice to be around her all the time and it still is. I LOVE watching movies and shows with her, playing pokemon GO, and going on cute dates. As of i want to October she has been very lacking in everything she knows i love to do with her. I ask her to watch a show with me, no she doesn't have the energy. I ask her if she wants to play games with me, no don't want to. I even try to initiate *pillow* time with her and get shut down. The main reason im getting so upset by this behavior is because when we started seeing each other she was all about doing things together but now if it's not something she wants to do; example. Watch TikToks for hours or cuddle and do nothing else. I get that she enjoys spending 3-4 hours on social media but i do not, so much so i even deleted my socials cause i used them mostly for NSFW content or very close to NSFW content and it made her feel insecure seeing the content in my FYP on TikTok or my feed on instagram. So instead of spending 400hrs trying to fix my algorithm i just got rid of them cause they were not important to me. But what is important to me and something i love to do is game. But she hates me gaming, she knew i was a gamer getting into the relationship and she acts all upset when i choose to sit and game for 3-4+ hours a day after i get off work to play games and unwind. Like i don't get visibly upset when she is on her phone doing what she chooses to do after work so why does she feel like she can do that to me? I even get off my games when she gets home from work dropping everything i'm doing to spend time with her just for her to glue to her phone after a couple of minutes so i end up just sitting there on the bed or couch doing nothing... Well today i kind of snapped and told her how i feel. That i feel seggz starved, like she wants me to spend all my time with her even if it means me being bored in the process, that its not fair that i feel uncomfortable enjoying my hobbies and interests in my own room in the house ive been living in for 5 years. All i get in return is ""i feel stressed and just am not in the mood for *pillow* as much as you"" but like what about the other things? Making me feel uncomfortable, making me feel guilty for doing things i love and enjoy, for even getting aroused in bed i feel guilty and uncomfortable. Its not fair to me imo and im thinking about getting rid of my pc and my switch cause i love her and dont want to give her reason to be upset with me but at the same time id be so bored all the time with nothing to do."

We are struggling a bit financially. He has known said coworker since HS (we are now all in our 30s) and I think it's safe to say that they are fairly close (they don't hang out or anything but they talk every day). At that point the coworker said ""don't worry about paying me back with money, you can just take me to and from places I need to go until we are squared away."" My husband accepted this offer.  Since he loaned my husband the money, my husband has carted him around easily 8 times. He has exceeded the $40 that he gave him and he just keeps calling and asking for rides. Well, now my husband's truck is spent and he has been using my vehicle to get to and from work. I have made it clear that under no circumstances is he allowed to cart this guy around using my vehicle and my gas. I don't even care if he offers gas at this point, I don't want him in my car. Now, it may be because I feel my husband is fully being used at this point because a few of the places my husband has driven this guy has been a good 30 minutes away. That and I don't like the guy anyways. Never have. Mix that with the fact that he doesn't respect people's belongings (smokes blunt after blunt whenever my husband picks him up and leaves the vehicle reeking) and I'm just all set with having this man anywhere near my shit. So I told my husband this guy is not to be in my vehicle at all. He said ""Fine by me"" and we moved on.  Well, yesterday my husband calls me and he like sheepishly says ""John is begging me for a ride to go get his kid and I feel bad."" I reminded him that guy is not to be in my car. He said ""I know but like.. what am I supposed to say to him? I feel bad because he did loan me that money a while back."" So I said ""Yeah, money that you've already paid back. He is not to be in my car and if you go against my wishes you won't be taking my car again."" Well, the guy happened to walk up to the car window when I said this and my husband had me on speaker (per usual) so he heard me and got pissed. Said that he would never help us out again and I was controlling and ignorant. My husband did defend me, absolutely and told him he had better ""watch his fucking mouth"". But now my husband is saying I put him in a terrible position because he works with the guy. I told him that just because he works with him doesn't mean he needs to be a push over and get walked on.

I’m not sure if legally that’s relevant because I can’t find any info on it, but maybe fellow teachers will know.   It’s January now, so we’ve been in school for almost five months. I work at a school with disadvantaged youth and I knew that going into it. I expected difficulties, but I also expected to see people working to resolve them. During the last five months, I’ve expressed (and emailed) countless times about various issues I’ve witnessed and made sure to include ideas for solutions and offered my own time during prep times or after school to help with these issues. I’ll include a few below.   - troubled students who need psychological evaluation and services  - troubled students who are severely behind and need targeted interventions and tutoring  - students with severe truancy issues   - shortage of basic, necessary supplies like pencils, papers, sanitation supplies (tissue, wipes, etc)  - teacher burn out (this one is tricky, but one solution I gave and I’m currently working on is renovating the teachers lounge to make it a bit more relaxing)  - new teacher educational opportunities (I proposed having 15 minutes of our dedicated weekly PD time go to teachers voluntarily picking a topic and presenting a tip or idea to help out new teachers, which we have a ton in our school, think “what I wish I had learned the easy way”)  Anyway, so these are just a few. My boss doesn’t respond to any of my emails or messages. If I catch him around the school, he listens and acts like he cares, but then he doesn’t actually take any action to address these issues (that I can tell).  Which brings me to my question. Last week I was informed that I was scheduled for a formal teacher observation, a week after having had an informal observation (which I still haven’t received any feedback for). I asked to wait until I receive that feedback, and my email was ignored. I don’t even know if long term subs need to be observed, from a policy/legal perspective. I was also informed that it would be recorded, which makes me very uncomfortable because I hate being recorded or photographed in general. My boss said that all formal observations have to be recorded because multiple people in higher up positions would be reviewing the tapes.   So would I be an asshole if I maliciously comply and use my observation to subtly point out a lot of the issues I’ve thus far brought up and been ignored about?"

My ex gf (17F) and I (17F) dated for about 6 months but began arguing over some smaller things like this. At least she made me feel like they were small. So, one day before our homecoming dance, she had my best friend (we’ll call her P) homecoming propose to her as a joke with a minimal effort poster and my ex gf (we’ll call her K) acted all happy and continued playing into the joke all while one of my closest friends recorded it (she didn’t know I wasn’t okay with the joke). They had joked around about it days prior to it actually happening which I was uncomfortable with and voiced in passing that if they did that I would be a bit upset. I never thought they would actually do it though.  So, when it happened, I didn’t talk to P or K for the rest of that class and you could tell I was upset. But I decided to miss our school’s pep rally (since we had free blocks during those periods) because she needed to walk her dog since her brother neglected to that day and I didn’t want her to walk home alone. On the walk home, I was still silent but decided to try to talk it out once we approached her house.  I told her that I didn’t get why she would do that, that I told her it would make me upset and that I told her not to do it (which wasn’t true because apparently I did not but she didn’t tell me till days later). She kept defending herself saying it was just a joke and it was supposed to be funny and I replied with a joke is supposed to be funny to everyone involved and it wasn’t.   We argued back and forth for around an hour which she kept giving me excuses for the joke saying she thought it would only be a slap on the wrist from me for doing it, which made me even more upset. She even told me that I’m always getting upset which makes her upset which stuck with me since I never thought I always got upset with her until that point. I’m not the type of person to get upset without a reason so when she said that it hurt.   Eventually, I took the blame and boiled it down to I overreacted and should’ve told her more that I wasn’t okay with the joke. She never apologized either. Then later that night I wanted to address why she thought I always got upset which spurred another argument which lasted into the day of homecoming.   We eventually dropped the whole issue and pushed it aside to “have fun at homecoming”, which we did, but continued to have arguments like these which always ended with me taking the blame for overreacting and making her upset by being upset. We broke up later that month as well.  Everyone I talk to about this in my friend group (since her and I have the same friends) says I’m TA in this situation because I overreacted and didn’t make it clear that I would be upset over the joke. But I feel that it never should’ve happened in the first place without me knowing not without my consent. Even though this happened months ago, i wanted some unbiased outside opinions. So, AITA?"

The diagram pretty much says it all, but if I live in the neighborhood and approach the school parking lot from the north to pick up my kid it's evidently a big deal because its like I'm cutting in line.     However my contention is that queueing on the side street allows people to safely and calmly get into the neighborhood, relieves traffic on the main road and effectively allows everyone to get where they're going faster.  It should be a very typical traffic zipper into any other congested area, but because most traffic is coming from the other way it seems to be problematic in spite of the fact that its the rational way to operate.  It's a 2 way street and there's no signage indicating any required action- yes, coming from that direction will typically get you a shorter line.  It doesn't change the fact that it's a better plan.

My position is I'm pretty busy in the morning, it isn't my job to wake you up as well. My morning routine is: alarm goes off at 6:25, I lay there for about 5m.  6:30, I go wake up 2 of our kids (10f, 6m).  The oldest, 12f, has a later start time and pretty much takes care of herself until it's time for me to take her.

They get dressed while I go put the dog out, feed him, make my coffee, make their breakfast and their lunches. They have to be out the door for the bus at 7:05 so I'm usually cattle prodding them along to keep them on time. This morning my husband walked in at 6:55, usual time, while I was making lunches and told me he wants to get up in the morning too.

He works off shore for weeks at a time, so when he is home he doesn't have a job to go to. I have a part time job I go to while the kids are in school. That is a whole other source of conflict. Me having a job at all, not that it's just part time.  Why I may be TA: it wouldn't take me much time to give him a kiss and tell him it's time to get up, and I could make him a coffee with mine. He works away from home for weeks at a time with an unpredictable schedule. He provides most of the money.  Why I don't think I'm TA: he's an adult. I carry all the mental load of the house when he is gone for work.  He does some things when he comes home, but nowhere near 25% much less half. Adding on the responsibility of telling him it's time to get up and making his coffee every morning kind of makes me feel like he's another kid, not my partner.  So AITA here?"

Truth be told, it was my first time using wireless ones and I really wasn't able to get used to it. I had a constant feeling that they are too big for my ears and are going to slip off (it wasn't because of buds' size, it was the matter of design) because of what using them was making me really anxious. As a result, I was almost never using them, unless I was at home and mostly sticked to the wired ones while being outside.   Nonetheless I appreciated comfort of not having wires dangling around me. So, when my friend gave me for Christmas a gift card to a big electronic store, I decided to buy myself another wireless pair of headphones. This time however I chose them myself, making sure that they'll be comfortable for me to use. It was a great purchase, I love the new headphones and using them really makes me happy, as it's far more comfortable to talk with my closed ones whenever I want to (my family lives quite far away and I call them almost daily).  Few days ago John noticed my new headphones and got really upset with me. He says that I am unresponsible, buying something that I already own and that I should spend the card on somethinh I really need. The thing is, I don't need any new electronic at the moment and I wanted to have headphones which I'd like using. I told him so but he keeps saying that in this case I should leave the gift card for now ""for emergency"". Also, that I am childish and create problems out of nothing as he doesn't know anybody who'd have problems with the model of headphones he gave me, so I should be more appreciative of his gift.  I got upset and told him that since it's *my* gift card then I can use it however I want and he accused me of having a spending problem. I really doubt that it's the case (I don't earn too much but I never had any problems with uncontrolled purchases or debt, too) but maybe he's right and I should try more to get used to my headphones from him? Maybe I really am childish, after all.  AITA for buying new unnecessary headphones even if he already bought me a pair?"

I’ve been lurking here for a while but truly need some advice…sorry it’s kinda long. My wife (46F) and I (50M) have had a tough couple years.  Married for 6 years, together about 11, we share 4 kids (2 each).  Three boys are working away and stay with us when they get home, which is rare.  My stepdaughter (15F) is a great kid and is a pleasure to raise. Wife moved across country to go to school for 1.5 yrs, we saw each other every 4-6 wks during this time.  Then she moved home for a month and took a temporary job that requires her to travel, she’s only home on wknds for the next 3-4 months then gone for good.  So we’ve spent a lot of time apart and it’s adding up.  She wasn’t supposed to have to move again but needed to to complete her certification.  This whole thing was to double her pay and she has. I am at home with the child, I care for her like she’s my own and she keeps me very busy.  I also work 2 jobs so life is hectic but we manage. Here’s the issue: wife gets to come home early last night-one night early - and I’m excited for sex and tell her so.  She comments that she hopes I miss “all of her”.  I take that as her meaning all I want is sex and that’s she’s just an object.  I am mad. She gets home, we talk about it and she says she just wishes I would put more energy into non-sexual activities.  I take that as either she doesn’t want sex as much as me and I am pushing it way too much or she is not attracted to me and either way my libido is dead now.  We go to bed, me seething and her asking if we can have sex to which I say no.  It’s not to punish her, I am actually just frustrated and truly exhausted and want her to know that I can go (and have went) without sex for long periods of time. Some details you may need:  I quit drinking just over 2 yrs ago since I knew I needed to if I was going to properly care for a teen by myself.  I started some antidepressants in dec since winter is always brutal for me and and I’ve tried to tune in everything else-diet, exercise, sleep, etc and the pills work, sex drive is fine and I’m way less cranky and can actually share how I feel. We have a great sex life and it’s only gotten better over the years.  On the wknds she’s been home these past few months we probably average 3-5 sessions in a wknd and I figured we were in sync about that. Now I’m not sure.  I feel totally shut down and one of the only things getting me through this tough time has been looking forward to our rendezvous.  Now i feel shut down and would be happy to just go sexless -I guess it’s to punish her but also I want to show her it’s not all about the sex.  It’s not the one thing I used to look toward to right now. I was married to a very abusive woman in the past so my wife thinks I fight like a pro while she just shuts down and gets quiet.  I’ve asked her to open up since I’d rather know what’s up than guess…I work all day today but can’t concentrate at all, told her we need to talk tonight.  She’s only home until Sunday and I work all wknd…"

I wasn’t with him the first year he applied, but I was with him the second time, and he made a bunch of very foolish mistakes when applying that I wouldn’t expect someone wanting a PhD to make, especially someone who had done the applications once before. He admitted that because of his ADHD he has issues with being organized and asked if I would help. I agreed that I would, but when application time came around again, he kept making the same dumb mistakes from last year. When I would tell him he was making a mistake and remind him of what happened last year, and I’d get a blank look and “Huh??"" or an argument about how I'm wrong. So I decided I'm not helping anymore if he's just going to ignore me.   He just realized he missed deadlines of several schools that he really liked and is upset. I am frustrated because I had warned him about this a few months ago, and all I got was ""December? For Fall 2023 admission?? Huh??"" as if it was so crazy to suggest such a thing. He said that maybe he shouldn't go for a PhD after all, and I thought that he was serious about wanting to do something else, so I told him that there are other things he could do instead and that most people don't get PhDs and are fine.  He looked hurt and asked if I really felt he should give up. I decided to tell the truth and I said I think he'd be better off doing something else because he still doesn't seem to understand what he needs to do to even apply, and the work is only going to get harder without anyone there to hold his hand. He argued with me that if he got his organization under control he'd be fine, but I told him it wasn't just that, it was his tendency to dismiss any info that doesn't fit his preconceived ideas to the point where he won't even check the school admissions website because he's convinced he already knows what to do. He wants to do high level scientific research, but is struggling with the low level info gathering that he needs to do now.  He got really upset, and I told him I was sorry I really wasn't trying to hurt him and I feel bad that this hasn't worked out. AITA for telling him what I really think?"

We do have our differences though - I'm a bit of an extrovert and my sister has always been a very overly sensitive person, introverted, and extremely self-conscious (if she doesn't think she looks good, she won't go outside) My parents and I used to tease her by calling her hotheaded, but recently my parents have started catering to her sensitive behavior. I'm in university a couple of states away, close enough to visit occasionally but obviously I'm not always around. My parents and my sister have gotten really close in the time that I've been away, and I didn't realize they decided to stop teasing her about her sensitivity; I thought that was still our running joke.  I occasionally rant to my cousin (31F) about my sister since we are all very close (we're pretty much all just sisters), and my cousin agrees that my sister has always been sensitive and gets annoyed easily, and sympathizes with me when my sister is being short.  My sister and my parents came to the conclusion (without letting me know) that my sister may have some deeper sensitivity issues and she might not just be a hormonal teenager. I came back for break once and I called my sister a hothead because she was getting mad that she couldn't get a box open, and my mom defended her when she got upset I called her that. I called out my mom for taking her side (not knowing that the family had decided to baby her) and I went upstairs visibly upset. My dad noticed and called my whole family up, and in the heat of the conversation we were having I told them that I tell my cousin about our fights and that she validates my feelings and gives me input. My mom and sister blew up at me for making my sister look bad to other family. My sister has always tended to overthink things and hyperfocuses on mistakes (she's very socially awkward and will think about things she said for days or weeks) and now she says that she won't be able to forget that my cousin thinks about her differently for being sensitive. My mom said that she had been making huge progress in her self-confidence, and that I ruined all of that progress by revealing that I ranted about her.  I don't think I did anything wrong, and talking about things that bother me is just my way of coping with my problems. I don't think my family understands that that's just how I deal with things. My sister and I haven't spoken for over a month, and I don't feel the need to apologize.

I also have 2 kids (10m and 12f).  My husband's ex had mental health issues and my husband didn't want her alone with the kids so shortly after they got married, he hired Lucia (mid-late 50's at the time) to take care of his stepdaughter, then later their kids. He was eventually able to leave his ex and they moved to be closer to his family. He didn't want to fire Lucia so she moved in with them.  Lucia is very close with these kids. They call her grandma, she taught them Spanish, and she's very loving towards the kids. It's not unusual to see the youngest sitting in Lucia's lap while they watch a movie and she hugs and kisses them all the time.  My kids and I moved in and, while she's nice to us, she treats my kids like an afterthought. I don't pay her for my kids. They take the bus to school and are capable of walking to and from the bus stop, making themselves a snack, and doing their homework. The only thing she needs to do is, when she makes dinner, I need her to make some for my kids.  &amp;#x200B;  There are two problems with this arrangement. First, she makes Mexican food all the time. My kids don't eat Mexican food so my daughter ends up making dinner for herself and her brother half the time. Second, she's extremely loving to my husband's kids while pretty much ignoring mine. It wouldn't kill them to speak English around my kids or for her to not hug and kiss them every 30 seconds. It makes my kids uncomfortable and a little jealous.  I told my husband about this and he said he didn't know what I was expecting since Lucia had been with those kids for 12 years. I told him to talk to Lucia about making things fair between the kids. Speak English so my kids could be included in the conversation, make food that all of the kids like, include my kids in their outings (once a week Lucia picks the kids up from school and takes them out to get ice cream or hot chocolate and sometimes they go out for dinner after that).   My husband says no because his kids love Lucia's Mexican food, the ice cream has been a tradition with the 4 of them for 7 years, the kids will start to forget their Spanish if they don't speak it regularly with Lucia, and because she's been their grandma since the oldest was 3 and the younger two were born so having her change anything now will be harmful to his kids.  I told him that he can't just think of his kids anymore and that keeping things the way they are is harmful to my kids but he's refusing to change anything and is blaming everything on me because I was the one that told Lucia that my kids don't need a nanny and didn't invite her to any family activities so she could become closer with my kids.  Since he's refusing to talk to her about it himself, I'm considering talking to her but I wanted to know if I was the asshole for wanting my husband to do it"

Whilst having a spare room I've never had anyone else live with me. Recently though a friend was in a dire situation so I said I'd rent them the room cheap so that they could get out of their toxic boyfriend's place.   The friend, now roommate, has a history of mental health but no official diagnosis. They are also nocturnal, typically waking up about 4pm. I myself struggle so can empathize but despite my mental health issues I am fiercely independent. My roommate I have learnt is not...  The apartment is a 5 minute walk from a huge grocery store. Every time they'd want to do their groceries they'd ask me to go with them to help carry it back as ""due to their mental and physical health"", they are unable to do it alone. Initially I was happy to help but they then came to expect me to help them every time to which I began refusing and have only done so since when is convenient to me as I work full-time and they do not work at all. This hasn't been a problem since standing my ground.   After a couple months of living together however, they asked if they could keep a stray cat that had been hanging around the complex. Which I agreed to on the condition I do not take care of it.   The issue is now though cat litter. They say they can't carry it back from the grocery store. They asked me to help and I said yes but emphasised I had plans in the evening. I knocked on their door at 2pm to ask if they wanted to get the cat litter and they asked if we could do it later as they were still sleeping to which I reminded them I was busy. They then asked if it was possible to do it the next day then instead to which I said yes but it would have to be early in the afternoon as I wanted to keep my evening open. I asked if they could get up earlier, they just laughed and proceeded to get pissed at me. Ever since they've been really cold and distant with me.   It's made me feel like a bad friend for not helping but equally the cat isn't my responsibility nor is their health.  I cared for my dad and when I was younger because my mom was to depressed to do it and in turn I ended up having to look after her as well. I think this is why I'm so independent and had chosen to live alone up until now, I just want to look after myself. I don't get much time off work, so when I do, I want time for me. I want to help my roommate with their problems of course which is why I gave them somewhere to live and agreed to the cat. I didn't expect the support to extend beyond that though... Is that selfish?

My son, that hubby adopted, was 10 when we married. My son was super hyper and socially immature for his age. My hubby has a son that's a year younger and was quiet and calm (like the rest of his side of the family’s kids).   My MIL once made my son cry over some crumbs in our kitchen. MIL baked a box of brownies with her bio grandson (which was a box my son and I were supposed to use to bake for neighbors). When brownies were done, my son got one and it made her so upset he left crubs that she yelled at him! To the point he ran off so she wouldn't see him cry. He was 11 years old at this point.  She has jumped on him for silly things, dog piling when me or hubby we're already getting into my son about something minor. But if her bio grandson did the same thing, she was quiet about it...despite being the same issue in front of her. An example is when asking to eat more of the take out ordered.  My in laws relied on my son to help take care of sister and house when I had my last child. My sin helped show them where stuff around house is, clean, and take out garbage. The bio grandson sat in room upstairs and played video games.  My son with dydlexia, dysgraphia, ADd/ADHD graduated high school with 3.8 GPA, during Covid. I told her about it over the phone. She did not offer congrats, send a card, etc.  Her bio grandson, got kicked out of 2 schools, private and magnet, and was very lazy. My hubby's parents made excuses (he's too smart because he's in gifted program, etc). My stepson evevtually was allowed to graduate with less credits- just to get him out of school! Christmas comes and my little girls with hobby got cards, my stepson got a card from MIL. My son got nothing.  I texted her and told MIL that I felt like it was mean that she couldn't bother putting tan extra Christmas card in for my son, asking why she sent stepson money and card for graduating (snd brought that up in front of me when did nothing for my son!), and why she's harder on my kid.  MIL called me crying, telling me to stop. Asking don't I know how much they love my son, that I am insecure. I admitted that may be the case, maybe I need reassurance at this point. But the entire time she cried, insisted she treats all kids the same, she got bio grandson grad gift because his mom sent a formal graduation announcement to her, and she claims she never sent a Christmas card to my stepson.  I took on lots of blame- admitting I could be insecure, apologizing for making her cry. She never uttered an apology or anything resembling that she heard my feelings.  Then…she said her husband will not make it to his birthday (next month- he’s in amazing shape, btw) and she will die soon too. Then I will be happy?!  I told her that wasn’t a fair statement, I don’t wish death on them, etc.  Am I an a-hole???"

The trip was for five days. Ella and Mike are also a couple, while the remaining three people mentioned are single. Prior to booking the trip, Greg and I made it clear that while it was a friends' holiday, as a couple we’d also like to sometimes go off and do our own thing, which everyone said was cool.   We arrive at the hotel on the first night, and most people are tired from traveling and want to relax by drinking or eating at the hotel bar. Greg and I are itching to explore the city, though, so tell the group we'll join them at the bar later, but we want to get out and explore. Jake asks if he can join us, and we say sure.   About an hour after we leave, Tom starts spamming my phone, asking us to come back to the bar and hang out with everyone else. We say we'll return in a while, but we're having too much fun exploring the city. My phone then runs out of battery, and Jake's and Greg's phones aren't working in the foreign country. The next day, Tom was sulking because everyone else at the hotel bar ended up going to bed early, and he'd tried texting my phone to ask where we were so he could join, but obviously I never got the messages as my phone died. He wouldn't let it go all day, and said we should have all stuck together.   The second day of the trip, the entire group hung out together all day and evening. Then, on the third day, Tom was dead set on traveling one hour to a different region of the country as he had an old school friend who grew up in the region (note: his friend no longer lives in the region, so there was no pressing reason for him to go).   We googled the region, and it looked like a residential suburban area with nothing to do. So Greg and I said we'd sit it out and do some activities in the more tourist-friendly city, and everyone else agreed. Tom got into a sulk, so Sam agreed to go with him to the other region, but like we predicted, they ended up wasting a day of the trip as there was nothing but residential houses and one small café in the area.  On day four of the trip, we all hung out together again, but on the final day, Greg and I had a date day and evening together, and Ella and Mike did the same. The three single guys hung out together. We’ve been home from the trip a few days now, and Tom has been in a foul mood and complaining his vacation was ""ruined""  He claims it wasn’t cool of the couples to go off and do our own thing as it was a ""friend holiday"" and that we all should have stuck together as a group at all times rather than doing what we wanted as individuals.  I don’t think I am in the wrong or an asshole, so I won’t apologize. But am I the asshole?"

Said it would only be for a few months.  This is the house I owned before we married.  He did this knowing full well how I felt about it.  It’s been off and on for over 5 years.  He comes, stays for a few months, then leaves, then comes back.  Sometimes when he left, his daughter would stay for the summer.  I’ve asked when this will end to be greeted with anger. I’ve asked him to have his kids clean up after themselves, not leave garbage in the spare room, or the bathroom, to also be met with anger.  They don’t clean the bathroom.  He lived with us for 2 years straight basically and wouldn’t clean the bathroom even when I asked him to.    I’m tired of it now.  I’ve actually had to tell them myself that they need to clean up after themselves as I’m not a maid and this isn’t their house.  I don’t care if they come and spend the weekend but I resent having to completely clean two rooms of garbage after they’ve been here for a month or so.  He doesn’t back me up when I mention the mess or garbage.  It’s frustrating.  AITA for not wanting grown ups to live with me off and on til the end of time?"

We’re not that close but we both share a love of reading. Anyway, I was reading said book whilst in the bath last week and it led to me accidentally dropping it into the tub.  The pages are ruined and the book has expanded quite a bit, but in my opinion it’s still readable. Of course though, I still felt very guilty and I offered to replace it. She refused and said that I shouldn’t worry about it- accidents happen after all- but now I’ve found out that she’s going behind my back and telling all our mutual friends about it. She isn’t saying it directly but she’s heavily implying that I didn’t try to do anything about it.  I’m pretty sure I’m NTA but some of my other friends say I should just be the bigger person and replace her book- however I’m feeling quite hurt by her words and am now very reluctant to purchase something for her.  So what should I do about it, should I just ignore it or just go ahead and buy her another book?"

She also tried to convince him that I’m manipulating him even though the move was both of our ideas. On top of all of that, she made a comment about my grandma who has terminal cancer. She said “you could just push the wedding back since she’s not going to make it anyway” and then claimed it was supposed to make me feel good. She also said “right now is not a good time for you to have a baby, but it might be a good time for us.” She lost her son (34) last year and pretty much wants to take care of the baby for us. She uses losing her son against my fiancé as well. Since moving and obtaining better jobs, she has continued to call and harass my fiancé and cannot keep my name out of her mouth.

Well my parents consider anything below 95% is horrible cause all of their nephews and friends children get such amazing mark. Well I don't get as much but neither am i the worst student ever. In fact i'm a pretty decent student in my class. But it's never enough for my parents so they yell at me. If i get sick they yell at me for getting sick. If I took my phone even for a second (and no i'm not exaggerating cause i would literally pick up my phone and my mom would just explode.) They yell at me for the extra curricular activities i indulge in and yet again yell at me for not going for more extra curricular activities cause my family friend's daughter goes for drums, dancing, singing, guitar and get 98% in her exams. I used to go for dancing, music and karate but I stopped this year. There is never a day where my mom doen't yell at me or scream at me that i am useless because i can't do good in anything. She has even said that not only am i bad at studies and other activities but i would make a bad wife too cause i cant cook or clean properly. And that nobody will ever love me for who i am. cause i am just a disappointment and a sadist who can't even do the bare minimum for my parent. My mom and dad has also scream at me numerous times asking why she got a daughter like me and why i couldn't be 'normal' or like friend who is perfect is every shape and form.  Them being indian parents also think metal health is facade despite being qualified with high education with my dad being a civil/ mech engineer and my mom having a major in zoology cause I shouldn't be sad as long as i has food 3 times a day and a roof over my head.

He comes a lot to our house and the other day he brought his son (14M, Brad). I remembered Brad from when he was a little kid but I had not seen him in a while so he was very different and I barely recognized him. Brad was very eager to talk with me in a way I found a little annoying but I tried to be nice because of his family situation.  We talked about how I was the captain of my school's female Track and Field team. Brad told me he intended to be in the football team when he starts high school next grade and he says he has been training a lot. Henry then proposed that in order to help him train, we should do a race between Brad and me to see who was faster. I thought it sounded fun but Brad was relunctant. He ultimately agreed because he didn't want to go against his father desires. My dad was also against the idea but at first I didn't understand why.  My father privately told me that if won the race, Henry would be very disappointed with Brad and that it could be very bad for the both of them. He explained that the divorce has been very difficult for Brad and Henry's relationship, so Brad's training has been a method for them to bond. He being defeated by a girl would destroy all that. He said that I should lose on porpuse but I totally refused to do anything like that. He seemed really worried  about Brad but I was not going to do it.  We did the race and it was fair and square with both of us giving our best. Brad beat me but not by much. Henry looked reasonably satisfied and Brad acted like a really good winner, being happy but also congratulating me in my intense performance. My dad was mad at me because he realised I had run with all the intention of winning, ignoring his wishes. He said he was sad because I had prioritized my competitive mentality over the meantal wellbeing of a kid. He argues that even if everything turned out fine, I shouldn't have taken that risk.

Afterwards I ignored them until I was home.  This week was my masters degree graduation ceremony. I had to attend to be eligible to get a ""best masters thesis""-certificate. I invited my parents and they paid for the tickets -60$ each.Ticket price included a buffet. I would've opted out of the buffet if possible. I hate buffets.  When we arrived it was massively crowded, the room with the tables and the stage was packed. When everyone sat, it was barely possible for a thin person to walk sideways between the tables. With around 300 people in the room, it was awfully loud and impossible to make conversation + there was a speaker next to us.  After 3 hours of ear torture it was time for the buffet at 8:30pm I was already considering asking my parents to move to a restaurant when the ceremony is over but I wanted to wait and see how the buffet would be handled. If each table would be called to go to the buffet at seperate times I would've considered eating from the buffet. Instead, it was ""first come first served"". I immediately told my parents that I am not going to eat in this case.  I suggested moving to a nearby restaurant I know. It was a 5 min walk away and I was desperate for a more relaxed space and I just wanted to chat with my parents without having to scream across the table. Heres how I remember the conversation:  Me: Hey how about we relocate to a nice restaurant I know?  Mum: Why? I paid for the buffet. I guess if you pay whatever  Me: Yes I will gladly pay for the restaurant  Mum: Hm no it doesn't make sense, theres no difference to wait in line for the buffet and wait at the restaurant.  Me: I guess I'll eat a frozen pizza at home then  My dad didn't say anything and went to the buffet. My mum followed, asking me if she should bring me something. I declined,she doesn't know what I like to eat anyways.The evening that was supposed to be ""me being celebrated"" turned into ""my wishes being ignored"".  I decided to ignore my parents and just sit on my phone after 20min they came back from the buffet. My mum made remarks how the food was good but i ignored it. It didn't look good to me anyways. When both were done I looked at them and said: ""great if you are done, can we leave?""  My mum asked me why I was being bitchy and I just said: ""you really don't know? you have no idea why I am pissed after you declined my proposal even though I would've paid?""  She said: ""No you are being unfair""  Me: ""Well I think the same way about you""  My mum tried to make conversation in the car, but I only kept my answers short. I told them to drop me of at another place, so they could be home 30mins earlier. When I left the car I quickly apologized for my behaviour and thanked them for coming and driving me.   AITA?"

He believes that if he is right he can express himself however he is feeling, which is almost always angry. I have asked him many times to just communicate his frustrations differently, change his tone but he says I’m not allowing him to express his feelings. Am I really asking too much for him not to explode with anger just because he is mad? Or am I really limiting his emotions? He says that by making an argument about his justified anger and not about what made him mad in the first place is absurd. AITA for taking issue with his delivery or should I work on seeing past the delivery and focus on what it is that is upsetting him.  Example; I was driving us to a location and I needed to put the address into my cars gps. A quick 20 seconds tops to do this. I had turned into alleyway to do this. I stopped close to the entrance, no car behind me, at it was late at night and there was no activity on this alley. He raised his voice and started to yell at me for not moving further up and more off to the side to do this. Berating me about how unsafe I was being. When I asked him to not yell and just tell me, he got even more angry because, since his point is right his behavior is justified. He said since I’m in the wrong I shouldn’t be able to get mad at him and make it about his angry outburst."

I am still on maternity leave and my husband will stay home for a while after I return to work, but the baby is reaching a age where it would be okay to have someone else watch her for short periods.   We have discussed a lot about the ways we want to raise out children among the years and it has come up how my husband was physically disciplined as a kid. He isn’t traumatized from it (his own words) but recognizes that it was not okay even though it was way more common in his childhood than now. We want to do gentle parenting and obviously, no physical or emotional violence allowed. We have discussed how we want everyone who is with the baby to obey the same ground rules. I especially have said that his mother needs to be informed that she cant treat our child the same way he raised my husband. My husband agrees but has a hard time discussing difficult or negative topics especially with his family, he is going to therapy though.   I recently visited MIL with the baby and the topic of her babysitting came up. I decided that this would be a good time to discuss the subject of how we would like people around the baby to act. I explained gentle parenting etc. and how no type of violence would be allowed. My MIL kind of laughed at this and wondered who would want to hurt a child and how it’s not rocket science to raise a kid. I then brought up the ways my husband was physically disciplined as a kid as examples of what’s not okay. MIL said again that she doesn’t understand why this is discussed since those things are so ”obviously wrong”. Then I kind of got annoyed and said that well, she did them in my husband’s childhood so I saw it as fit to mention.   She clearly got kind of sad/offended and said that it’s different when it’s your own kid, how times are different and how she feels bad that we need to dig the past and don’t trust her as a caregiver. She also mentioned that she would feel more comfortable discussing this with my husband. We kind of left it at that and I went home shortly after.   I told my husband about our interaction and he had no problem with me bringing it up since he agrees and finds these types of discussions with her mother really hard. But I wonder if I should’ve ”forced” him to do it anyways or just not bring up his childhood at all to MIL since it clearly hurt her."

Also I would NEVER expect a guest to clean anything except to clean up after themselves (Dishes in the sink at least, Trash in the trash can, etc etc etc... ) because to me, I have guests because I enjoy their company, and they're on vacation."

He's a purebred Aussie Shepherd and he really he's my best bud now (cliché, I know.)     For the most part he's a great dog, lots of personality, intelligent, and a huge cuddle baby, for at least me and my spouse. Over the years he has gotten grumpy and I try to do all I can do to fix it, walks to get energy out, playing to exhaust him, treat training, etc. We have had kids since we got him, another dog, and some cats. He's fine with the other dog, they play and get along, sometimes get snippy, and our oldest cats he ignores for the most part.      We got a new kitten and something just switched in my dogs' brain. When he ignores the other cats, he gets uncontrollably excited about this kitten, I don't think he's being malicious, but he'll dart at them and basically pile steamroll them over and nose jab them alot (It's a weird Aussie thing). And yes, that behavior is a problem, a 50lb dog running at 3lb kitten like that and I am working on it as much as I can daily.      Anyway, the Kitten doesn't leave our bedroom much, mostly because of the dog, but I try to get them to leave so they can explore the house and get used to everything, our Aussie saw the kitten, ran at them, scared the bejesus of them.      My spouse immediately just screams at him (as they often do, instead of trying to help with the actual training) and followed it up with ""I don't even fucking like this dog anymore"". And when I called them out and said ""Don't say that and screaming at them isn't helping his training"". they rolled their eyes and shook their head, mouthing something, not sure what. I called them out again ""Don't roll your eyes at me like a spoiled teenager, that's childish.""      They then stormed off, slammed our bedroom door and haven't spoken to me since. AITA?"

My building has a small resident's gym with about 8 pieces of cardio equipment, 3 bikes, 3 stair / elliptical machines, and 4 treadmills (on top of some strength training machines / weights areas / 2 benches).  I use the treadmill for 4 hours a day (light jog, it's not like I'm Usain Bolting for that long) from 6AM to 10AM (gym operates 6AM to 10PM). During this time the gym is almost empty from 6-7:45\~ and again from 8:30\~ to 10AM, Pre 7:45 seems too early for people and post 8:30 too late (assume getting ready / starting work etc.).  I'd say at an absolute MAXIMUM all 4 treadmills are occupied for perhaps 15 minutes every other day. I did a test today and for the entire 4 hours there was at least one treadmill free, and I was alone for over 3 hours of the run. There are plenty of days where capacity isn't hit at all, and the days on which it is it's a very limited time slot from maybe 8:15-8:30. On average I probably run alone for over half the time and with 1-2 others (So still at least 1 treadmill free) for the entirety of the rest.  I understand the concerns around hogging equipment and I'm not remotely denying 4 hours is a very long time. However, there is clearly capacity in the gym (which in Manhattan we pay a ludicrous amount to live in anyway, obviously). You could argue I should step off from 8;15-8:30 if I can see the gym is full, but even then it's 15minutes 1-2 times a WEEK that all 4 are in use.   Either way, we got an e-mail from management reminding us the max to be on any cardio equipment is 45 minutes. I am 99% sure it's aimed at me, as this morning about 3 hours in a lady (I believe the building manager's assistant) informed of the rule tapping me on the shoulder. I continued asking why it's a rule and gestured at the 3 free treadmills next to me. I asked if I hop to another treadmill does that comply with the rule? What about switching to Peloton? She didn't have an answer and just said the rule ""comes from management"" and left. 15 minutes later a doorman comes, same thing, same conversation, he asks my apartment number and I tell him, and he again repeats it's from management and walks off  Am I insane or am I missing something here? If the treadmills were in high demand and I was single handedly blocking 25% capacity for the entire morning slot I would of course be a gigantic asshole with no consideration for others with busy schedules. As I have tried to point out in this post that is NOT the case. I'm sure some people will say clearly I'm not telling the truth as clearly people have complained or something. There are cameras in the gym and if management confronts me I will challenge them to review footage and if they can find more than a 15minute slot at once or 30 minutes throughout the entire week where  all 4 are in use (when I'm there) I will back down.   I really don't understand, but, reddit, am I missing something and am I in fact the asshole?"

Well, the point is that before we had a person who helped us cook but we had to move and we still couldn't hire anyone, plus we had a baby a few months ago and we don't have that much time to cook for everyone every time someone comes home.   The point is that my daughter (7F) made new friends and they wanted to come home for lunch so I told his parents that I didn't have time to cook and that if they were okay with me giving them vegan food, because although it sounds crazy, many people don't allow their children to eat ""that"". some of them said that they would bring their own food and others that it was okay if they ate vegan food. Well, the day came and no one brought their own food so I fed them what I had at home (which since our baby was born is mostly prepared and frozen food) they ate vegan cheese burgers with fries and vegan ice cream for dessert and the truth is that the kids loved it, because it was nothing from another world, just a meal made in another way.   One of the girls (8F) said that she liked the food and that she would like to stop eating meat because she loves animals too, and I honestly don't know why she said that because I only cooked for them, I didn't tell them anything else. But apparently my daughter did tell them something, and her friend told her parents what she ate and what she thought about animals and now her parents are mad because they think that what I did was wrong. For them it was not right to give their daughter vegan food and that the best thing would have been to order a pizza, that feeding them that only makes them think ""stupid things"", but I don't think it was bad, it's just food and anyway I warned before that if they didn't want me to eat that they should bring their own food. So AITA?"

He believes that it shouldn't be our duty to take care of her and let her into our house, but I had promised my ex that I would take care of his sister before he passed away (cancer) two years ago and want to keep that promise. I had told him as such and mentioned that she would be staying in our spare room and that I didn't want to go back on what I promised my ex, no matter what. He told me I was too generous and he was worried she would try and interject herself in our affairs and leech off us and that I should just let her stay with someone else or family (the only family close to our state is her other brother, but they're NC, so not a possibility).   I told him that if he didn't like the arrangement, then he was able to leave or stay at his moms (she lives five miles away) but that my decision was final. He stated he thought I was putting her ahead of him and us and trying too hard to appease somebody who wouldn't repay me.  I told him this was personal to me and that she is like family and I wanted to do all I could to help her. So, AITA?"

But then it turned out there are way more people who needed my help with this particular thing. My teacher (not the one we had the test with) suggested me going to the center and explaining it to everyone who needed this. I agreed. But then, my boyfriend said: ,, Don't go or I'll c*t myself"". I was too stunned to speak. I just went ahead and explained everything, and during the lunch break I told the school psychologist that I didn't know what to do. She ended up calling his parents for this. I knew he didn't want anyone to know but I didn't want to risk his life for this secret. Am I the a**hole?"

He eventually got into a fight with me, during which he shamed me for being alone (we had around 10 people each classroom) which eventually pissed me off. I was frustrated at how bitchy he was being for no reason. But i was more frustrated that trash like him looked down on me.

She went to a fancy restaurant with another, much older guy. I think he was an old professor of hers. They held hands, kissed, and drank.   I confronted her about it and she lied, saying she did go out but it was with her other friend. She even had said other friend text me and back up her story.

When I was a young child maybe 6-8 years old we happened across a small baby bird (found in pool pump floating strainer ). After keeping the bird in a box for a day or two, it got out one day. Initially the bird was just in the backyard so I went and got my mom (38) to help get it back in the box. At the time she was doing this thing called decopage and unfortunately was in the middle of it. After letting her know I went back outside to find the bird had made its way around the side of the house. At this point young me is starting to freak out and I run back inside to get mom again only to find she has not moved an inch. After frantically asking for help I return outside to find the bird in the front yard and now approaching the road. This road is busy, 35mph zone and nobody does the limit. Against my best efforts the baby bird hops its little way towards the road and I watch as it gets flattened to a pancake.  Instantly defeated and now obviously sobbing, I walk back inside to find my mother in the exact same spot. I let her know she let me down, almost got her kid killed, and I will never forgive her for this. That happened about 25 years ago and I have not forgotten. This event was only brought up once since it happened, and she did not seem terribly remorseful. Her response was ""So I was a bad mother?"" at the time her visiting wasn't on the line and I didn't delve into it further with her.   As an adult who now lives on my own, I recently decided to get two cats (Actually, one adopted me and then I had no choice but to get her a cuddle buddy. That can be a story for another day.). I love these cats. I would do anything for the little biscuit factories. Well, a few months go by and life is great. I get asked by mom when she can visit and suddenly my stomach sinks. I don't want her near my cats. I don't trust her, and I don't feel bad about it. Then I start thinking, man... that's kind of extreme to not let your mom into your house because of something that happened 25 years ago. I am conflicted. Am I the asshole here?  For the time being I have been playing it off, busy weekends. Schedules not lining up. Not feeling well. At this point I really just want to come clean or at least quit playing a charade as to why I am avoiding having her over. It just doesn't feel right. I am sure there is a better way I could have handled this, but I just have an issue surrounding the whole event. Even trying to comprehend it all these years later raises my heart rate and makes me start to think frantically. Please help by lending your opinions netizens of Reddit."

But what started with texting on Instagram, turned into them exchanging numbers and my boyfriend meeting up with her to help with fixing her broken car. From the very start of their first interaction my boyfriend was trying to hider her from me. When I texted him once to ask what he was doing he responded with ""nothing"", only for me to find out later that he was meeting the other girl at that time. Yesterday he had an important appointment in a different town, where he not only met up with the other girl, but also invited her to lunch and spent about 5 hours with her. When he got back, I confronted him about it and said that I didnt understand why he would do something like that, considering he never once invited me to lunch. He assured me that there was nothing wrong and he wasnt interested in her. I told him how fed up I was with his double standards, because he expected me to keep my distance from a good male friend of mine and yet he was allowed to do something like this. A few hours later I find out that he actually also overed her to move in with him, because she didnt have a place to sleep. I got mad again and told him how hurt I was. He apologized and said he wouldnt do it again....Today he texts me that he has to run some errands and that he is taking her with him. So AITA?"

I'm going to be completely transparent to paint the best picture. I'm 29(f) and I am a recovering alcoholic. I have been sober for 5 months now (I believe, days are running together and I never wrote down the actual date). After I stopped drinking, my BC failed (doctors state it's due to my body being so used to alcohol that the chemicals in the BC no longer worked for my system). I'm currently 8 weeks pregnant. Obviously it wasn't planned but I do see this as a god send. I fully believe that this has changed my life for the better and even that this baby, my baby, has saved me. My husband and I are very excited. Scared shitless but excited.   All of my in laws know about my recovery. I've been with my husband for years and I couldn't even go to a family function without bringing booze. I had big issues. So they are all fully aware. They NEVER held it against me and have all been supportive but little comments have been thrown out there since finding out my pregnancy status and it's really like.. bothering me, I guess. Or not even bothering me but I just don't have the patience or tolerance for it. Like whenever I become irritated seemingly out of the blue (which I'm assuming is from my new found hormonal shift), the comments of ""oh it's because you're a dry drunk"" start in (for those wondering: dry drunk is a term they use when someone in recovery still gets the angry feelings they did from the alcohol, despite being sober- essentially). I've asked them to stop talking about it and usually they do.   But I had my MIL, both SILs and my own sister over yesterday for a little brunch/girl's day. I'm fatigued from hell and my morning sickness, while not severe, is picking up. The only thing I've been able to keep down is coffee and tuna fish, which I'm not supposed to eat a lot of, and cheese. It's been rough. Well, I make myself a coffee because for whatever reason it eases my stomach and my SIL immediately is at me. Starts saying ""You're not supposed to drink that!"" And ""You're just trading out one addiction for another""- after she saw me grab a second cup of coffee. I just kind of rolled my eyes and told her to get out. I was calm. I was just over it. She looked confused and started nervous laughing so I said ""No, I'm serious. Get out."" She did leave and it was pretty awkward after that. I'm just tired of her comments because it's usually her making them. Regardless, I've heard through the grapevine as of this morning that my MIL is telling everyone I was being ""petty as hell"" and that my SIL was just looking out for the baby. AITA?"

We enjoy drinking together and separately but I hate how he acts drunk.   Since Covid and kids he goes out maybe 3x/month but almost always gets pretty drunk, blacks out and loses track of time. When our 1st was ~6 weeks old he went out &amp; I encouraged him to put down his phone to stop texting me. He stopped being coherent and admitted his friend had gone home and he had picked up a girl at the bar, chatted her up, bought her drinks, went to a different bar with her for more drinks, exchange numbers and was texting with her until I caught him in his lie. We went to therapy and promised the world and he didn’t realize how disrespectful I’d think his actions were. after a few months if I asked for reassurance I was the bad guy for not being over it. Usually I asked respectfully but sometimes I was mean about it from being hurt and insecure still. I do not bring it up now unless we are fighting about how drunk he gets if even then. Ive asked he text me from time to time (I was also pregnant for a big chunk of this time and now have another newborn) &amp; communicate what time he expected to be home. Which started him telling me I was controlling.   He says asking for a rough time he will be home or update me if that changes is controlling. He almost always asks to have 1 more drink after that &amp; I say ok &amp; he stays for another hour+ losing track of time. But in that time he gets drunk. He swears he acts appropriate even if he doesn’t remember but I see when he gets home or when I’m out with him his inappropriate comments (recent examples are joking about his dick size to a friend of mine, putting me down in front of my family “lightheartedly”)  When he says he’ll be home at one time &amp; then keeps saying one more one more until it’s hours later (past midnight at least) then I’m annoyed. So he says I provoke him so it’s my fault he’s called me &amp; my family names like cunts and idiots, lied to me about who he was out with (when I’d have no issue with who he was with) and yelled at me with our newborn asleep 2 ft away.   I recorded the last time he yelled at me and he told me he was ashamed and he would start drinking less, so before he went out last night we discussed that again and he told me he wasn’t going to get drunk. Instead he stayed out 2 hours after he said he would but the real problem was he came home and couldn’t string a sentence together or keep his eyes open. I’m certainly not perfect but I am respectful of him and our relationship when I’m out. He could care less if I stay out late and always uses that against me but I always say that’s because I’m respectful and not sloppy when I get home. I also don’t stay out late &amp; I know that’s my choice.   AITA for asking him to not black out and be respectful? AITA for asking him to be home before midnight so he’ll have less drinks? AITA for taking away his release and trying to control the situation?"

We’re both 30, had a genuine connection, but didn’t label things since we had differing views on wanting to have kids. My other concerns were him being a smoker, still being attached to his ex, having had slept around a lot, and being a little hot and cold at times. He did seem honest.   I went away for a month to figure my feelings out for him and realised I did want to give it a fair shot. Before I was coming back, he invited me to go to his place from the airport but once I landed, he cancelled on me at the last moment with some excuse and then stopped responding. It was late at night and I didnt have a place of mine at that time. I was hurt that he did not even bother to ask where I was going to stay.   Next day, he came, apologised and gave me seemingly genuine excuses for his behaviour (a lot of them turned out to be lies). I forgave him and after a week, we had the what are we talk, we agreed to be with exclusive and it was all good. The week after, I felt something was off. One day, I saw another phone on his desk (an android since he is a developer), and it had notifications from another girl. It turned out he had been with her the night I came back, and had visited her after we made things exclusive. There were somewhat flirtatious exchanges with other girls too, one from the day we made things official. He convinced me these were platonic and the girl he had been visiting was his weed buddy and that he had never slept with her. He promised to stop talking with other potential girls, asked me to meet his friends, move in with him etc. I told him not to make false promises just to avoid conflict but he assured me he meant it. The next two months were riddled with anxiety. He did get better at texting and calling but he never made me meet his friends, never invited me to move in with him again, and kept stalling the STI tests which I had requested him to do. He would still stop replying mid conversation on some nights and be cold at times. My patience ran thin and I started questioning my sanity. I was convinced something was up and stalked his Instagram and noticed he was still befriending random women. He was travelling at the time and the limited contact made it worse for me. I FaceTimed him one day and expressed my concerns. He completely invalidated my insecurities but let it slip that he was indeed sleeping with his weed buddy at some point (apparently before we made things official). He told me he needed a week to think, during which he did not bother to check on me, even though he knew I was in a very bad place. After a week, we had a heated argument where he refused to take accountability. It’s been 3 months, I see him in office everyday. I’m living in the prison of my own mind, ruminating over what could have I done better. Am I not worthy, did I question him too much and pushed him away? What if he was actually not cheating? Should I have been more patient and given him time."

I wake up usually around 10:00 AM, sometimes earlier so that my bf and I can get started with our day. We either go to the gym before I go to work or I accompany him while he does Doordash (just a way for him to make money on the side) I’m not obligated to but it helps him out and it means we have time to spend with each-other.   Today I work an earlier shift at noon. We were supposed to wake up at 9:00 AM, get ready to go to the gym and be back by 11:00 AM so I can get ready for work. My work is a 20-30 minute drive away and we’d have to leave by 11:30 which means both of us would need to shower and get ready in 30 minutes.   Normally we solve this by showering together, however, we’re staying with his mother for the time being and she’s really weird about us doing that.   In my opinion it’d be a lot easier to go tomorrow, which is my day off. We would have way more time and it would be less of a time crunch to deal with.   My boyfriend was really insistent on going today. Which is understandable. He didn’t want to skip his workout today. However I enjoy going together rather than separately and this takes pressure off both of us to be somewhere on time so I asked him if he’d stay home with me and we can go tomorrow.   He refused at first, however eventually caved but now he’s angry at me. Am I the asshole?"

R was lovely but always very quiet, A was loud and fun and at first a good friend. I ended up spending a few evenings a week at their house. After a while I saw them arguing where she'd tell him to get back to his own country and that she hopes he gets hit by a train etc. This arguing came from the fact she was trying to control his every move. Whenever I got the chance to speak to R in private I could see how miserable he was. I didn't have feelings for him at first but the more we got to speak the more I realised how wonderful a person he is.  September came around and A was on a trip so she asked R to help me move house and we got to spend some quality time together. We stayed up til the small hours talking - absolutely nothing happened between us. However we had a conversation about having feelings for each other. I asked him to give his marriage one last try. When A got back from her trip she immediately started laying into him and after a couple of days he told her he couldn't do it any more, they broke up and he moved out. Within a week she was dating one of Rs friends, and is using him the same way she used R (spending all HIS money on drugs, botox, filler, hair extensions etc). She showed me screenshots where the new guy said the same things R used to say - that she makes him feel awful about himself and treats him poorly, so safe to say it's a pattern.  R and I started spending more time together and it was a couple of weeks before anything happened between us, but 4 months later its the best relationship I've ever been in. He treats me so wonderfully and I've never been so happy, he accepts me as I am despite the fact I have a disability and struggle with my mental health. I continued being distant friends with A though she didn't know that R and I were still in contact as she told me I had to cut him out of my life. It got to the stage where she would ask me to not wear make-up when going to visit her and wear baggy clothes so she would feel better about herself, and over the past few months we became distant and haven't spoken in a couple of weeks.  I found out from her 3 weeks ago she has reported R to the home office to try and get him deported out of hatred, not knowing that he has already applied to switch his spousal visa to a work visa. We weren't going to tell her that we were together, but after everything she has done I'm reconsidering. After 4 years of being abusive towards him, using him, and in recent months of being manipulative and controlling towards me too I've had enough. So I want to tell her that we've been together for a few months and that I won't be a part of her life any more. On the other hand, maybe I should just say nothing, block her on everything and move on.  So, would I be the a-hole for telling her?"

My friend and I never ever had any feelings for each other because I’m mostly into romantic relationships with this one guy at school. She and I became upset by this when we talked later. The principal was overreacting I think and I’m scared that he is right and that I can’t have friends younger. I am also closeted trans which makes me feel worse because now I’m worried to be friends with girls because of this. Am I the asshole?"

I take it to get to and from my kids school every morning and afternoon.  There are three schools along one section of the boulevard just off to both sides, so they aren’t fully visible since the boulevard is diagonal. There is a four block section of the boulevard that is a school zone, where the speed limit drops from 35 to 20mph, in proximity to the schools. There are large school zone signs with blinking yellow lights at the start on both sides and large end school zone signs at the end of this section. There are also multiple cross walks. There are no stop signs or traffic lights. However we are required to stop for pedestrians in a cross walk in my state. There are many kids walking along the side and using the cross walks during the morning and afternoon.   Every day when I get to the school zone, if the lights are flashing, I slow down to 20mph. No one else does. I get tailgated, honked at, flipped off, people whip around me and then break check me, some people even throw trash at me. One time someone went as far as to stop at the next light, not go when it turned green, and get out and yell at me for going too slowly.   This has been going on for a year and a half now and my kids are embarrassed and I am starting to question what is going on. I almost never see anyone else go below 35mph and I seem to be obstructing traffic.   So, Redit, AITAH for obeying the speed limit in a school zone?"

When we got back to our hotel from a long day at the parks, I was thrilled to see there was one parking spot left in the small lot on our side of the hotel. As I started to pull in, I got halfway into the spot and  I was greeted by two women standing in the spot having a conversation who started telling me I couldn't park there because they were saving it. I proceeded to tell them that's not how it works and they proceeded to tell me how their family members were moving their car around from the further parking lot to this one which was closer. I said it did not matter and that they needed to get out of my way. After a couple minutes of standing there I said they needed to move or I would call security. They called security themselves and so we waited a few more minutes for them to get there. We then both told our sides of the story to security during which he asked them where their family member was as it had now been some time and they were still not there. They then admitted that the family member was across the street at a Walgreens and not just simply moving their car. After that revelation, the security guard had no choice but to let me have the spot. I never got out of my car or aggressive with the ladies, even though they were not very pleasant. The reason I am asking AITA is the security guard made me feel like the asshole for not just driving away. He never apologized for the other guests doing that and was making comments to the other guests making it seems like he would find ways to make it up to them. I'm hindsight I probably should have just driven away to show my kids that you don't always have to win and you can just be the bigger person, but I still don't feel like I am the asshole."

I know that she has a job and her husband makes 6 figures and I make only enough to support me and my partner so her needing money was confusing. It was even more confusing when she asked for money for it 2 days before giving me the phone.  She then goes on about how she’s taken care of me since I was a kid (bought me things, food, presents) and how no matter how much she tries, she isn’t appreciated by anyone.

Fast forward to this January my 21 yo (who lives at home) is telling me he thinks he's allergic to the fur because his eyes get itchy when he comes home. I bought him eye drops and allergy medication which he doesn't use. I keep the house clean and am constantly vacuuming and sweeping. The dog is a very good sweet girl who usually listens well, I brush her outside almost daily and she goes every 8-12 weeks for a de-shedding bath, brush and blow out, but she is a husky and they shed a lot. My son had a massive meltdown because the dog was on ""his couch"". To be clear there are 2 living room areas on the main floor, one I've set up for all 5 children as a gaming/play room. He demanded I keep the dog off ""his furniture"" or clean the couch every time the dog goes on it. I do clean it everyday and I try not to let the dog go on the furniture but the couch in question is at the front window so when I go out that's where the dog chooses to watch for me to return. So in return I told him his options were to set up his own space in the partiality finished basement or move out. He yelled and threw a fit saying I was kicking him out and once he leaves I will never see him again. Then spat out that I was choosing my dog over my own child. He set up space in the basement for himself that night but hasn't spoken to me in a week now. No he doesn't pay rent or contribute to household bills, yes he works."

Every 5 minutes she'll come over and try to give me a kiss or some other similar kind of moderate PDA... sometimes even while I'm in the middle of a set. Regardless of whether it's actively interrupting my workout, it always makes me feel uncomfortable.  In other situations/contexts I don't mind it so much, but the gym is a place where   a) I'm trying to focus and need to be in the zone to be effective, and   b) PDA is less acceptable than the average public space  On the other hand, I know my wife is just trying to show how much she cares about me.  The obvious solution is to just go by myself, but she keeps asking if we can go together.   This definitely is not a ""seeking opportunities for connection because it's lacking in other areas"" type of thing. We spend a ton of time together, both at home and on dates/other activities, and our relationship is great. It's just this one particular situation that bothers me."

They had similar interests, same age, we thought it would work out.  We hear about the date and hear it went well from both parties.   I text my cousin a week later asking how things are going with him, and she she replies with “I wouldn’t know because he hasn’t talked to me since the date.” I talked to my fiancée and he said he would talk to his friend. His friend said he would talk to her, that he’s just been busy (🙄).   I meet up with my cousin a few days later, and I find out he hadn’t talked to her still. She was hurt, understandably. She told me how well the date went, or so she thought.  Fast forward a few months later, my fiancée and I get engaged. We are picking out our bridal party, and he wants this guy to be the best man. They have been best friends for 10+ years, so I can’t tell him no. It bothers me, and I don’t want to hurt my cousin’s feelings. I wanted her in the bridal party but I was scared things would be awkward. At first I didn’t add her to the party. But after thinking about it, I wanted her in it.   She knows he’s in the party and says it doesn’t bother her, but she’s one of those people who bottle things up. The guy has a girlfriend I just found out about and apparently started dating right after that whole thing with my cousin.

It was a slightly higher paying position than front desk and you got to work in the back area and do your own thing. When I worked front desk, there was only one person in that department for 1 year (let’s call him Jake) he was promoted from front desk to this position and he worked M-F 8-4, a gold schedule. A year into him working by himself, they decided to open a second position in that department, I applied. I was offered the job and in order to not modify Jake’s schedule, they had me work Thursday-Monday 10-6. This schedule made sense for how we ended up splitting the work and everything was fine. About a year into working in this department, Jake was offered a higher position in a separate department from the front desk. This left me to work alone in my department, and management stated multiple times that there were no plans to backfill Jake’s position. With me now working by myself, I brought up the question, “Could I have Jake’s old schedule?” The first time I asked this, management literally laughed in my face, saying that I’m too valuable to not have on weekends.   I worked by myself with my original Thursday-Monday schedule and the workload was not working out being alone. I collected evidence as to why my current schedule didn’t work with the daily tasks I had throughout the week and how a M-F made more sense. Management even agreed that my workload with my current schedule seemed overwhelming. About 2 weeks after that meeting, management came to me with a new schedule… Wednesday-Sunday 10-6. I asked why I am being forced to work the weekends. The answer was that it makes more sense for business to keep me on the weekend in case the front desk may need assistance and that I am supposed to be a “Jack of all trades” and help out wherever needed. I brought up Jake’s old schedule and they simply said that was a pre-arrangement that should have never happened, that they never liked his schedule. He was very successful in the position for nearly 2 years with that schedule but okay.   I tried to fight back that these schedules they were offering were not working. Their solution? To try and merge me with a separate department. They were so uncomfortable with me having weekends off…they thought it was better to merge separate departments with different responsibilities. I legitimately just want a M-F schedule so it makes my work load easier and manageable. My management keeps finding ways to keep me on weekends “just in case” they need help. Am I the asshole?"

Since then we have been speaking almost daily either by text or call he refuses to return to aa but I convinced to sign up for a local recovery service and he starts with them soon,however I’m finding talking to him less and less helpful to my own recovery,we used to talk about wanting to get better and more positive topics but now I frequently get messages from him showing pictures of Alcohol and drugs he’s brought.I didint mind at first because I understand how difficult recovery is and I’ve had many lapses myself plus he always seemed remorseful the next day and said he wanted to stop.Recently though his messages and calls about the drink and drugs he’s been using have become almost daily often telling me how cheap the Alcohol he brought is and how the drugs he is taking is “good shit” I try to steer the conversation back to recovery which is sometimes successful,but more often then not he goes into drunken rambles about nothing or about how aa is not good  and full of hypocrites.  Though this has not significantly effected my recovery yet I do find it quite draining I try to stay positive about things as much as possible because I know if I get into negative headspace I’ll be back on the drink.So I’ve started replying less and less I know I should just confront and tell him not to send pictures and videos of substances but as I’m early in recovery I do not want to come off condescending or rude.I’m hoping the recovery service I helped him sign up for helps him and we go back to having more constructive chats but until then I’m not sure what else I can do for him.Am I being a bad friend for not doing more or I am doubt the right thing for myself."

I (35F) have two kids (6y/o son and 5 y/o daughter) with my wife (30F). We recently (6 months ago) moved into a new neighbourhood, with a big garden and extra-friendly neighbours, much to my wife's request.   About two weeks ago, when I came home I noticed there were three kids in our house. They were about the same age as our kids and my wife told me they were our neighbours' kids, and that they'd met our kids when they were playing out in the snow. I brushed it off and didn't think much of it, especially since my wife told me it was pretty common for kids in this area to come over to their friends' house.  Three days ago, I noticed my wife was extremely down. I asked her what happened and she said the neighbors had given her a call and said that their kids were no longer allowed to come into our house. I don't know what their problem is, but I was like that's what they want for their kids so we should respect that.  My wife got mad at me and said if the neighbour's kids were to ask her to come in, she couldn't tell them to stay out. She's a kind person and that would be the opposite of what she'd do. I said maybe kids could go out to play together but she insisted that it is too cold for that.  I told her that we should still respect our neighbour's wishes or we could go have a face to face conversation with them. My wife simply said she can't leave those kids outside if they showed up. She called me heartless for even suggesting it.  So am I really in the wrong here? They're kids and they're neighbours their house is literally on the same street as ours."

Two years ago he begged for a dog. I've never been a fan of dogs but it was never at the fault of the dog either. It was because of my family. My mom was your ""let's have 8 dogs that keep popping out puppies and never clean up after them"" type of person. Therefore I grew up resenting dogs, their smells and their presence. I was bullied a lot because of how I smelt due to how many dogs we had. BUT now that I'm older and away from my mom and her dogs, I actually do like dogs. Some more than others of course (like my SILs dog is a fucking gem and I love her to bits and I would trade her with my husband's dog in a heart beat if my husband or SIL allowed it). That sounds mean but I'm just being honest. So anyways, my husband gets his dog. I tried endlessly to train her. Professional trainers included. She actually was given a certificate of achievement and taken out of training back 6 ot 7 months ago. At that point I was like 8 months pregnant.   Now one thing that I am completely against is the dog being on the bed. She can be on all the rest of the furniture (sofas, recliners, etc). Just not on the bed. She knows this. She NEVER tried to get on the bed until we had the baby. At that point she would whine while standing with her paws on the side of the bed  and I thought she was being curious about the baby but that's 100% not the case at all. It was jealousy. Resource guarding. We got her checked back in to training following her jumping up on the bed continuously following that and forcing her way in-between my husband and the baby, where she proceeded to push the baby with her paws and snuggle in to my husband while whining and eyeing my kid. It's ONLY when it comes to my husband. She does the same thing whenever he is holding the baby. She loses her fucking mind whining and trying to jump on him. It's dangerous so we got her back in to training (3 months ago).  Well I went to the store yesterday and left the baby with my husband. When I got home the baby was in his crib and the dog was up on the bed snuggling up with my husband, while peeking over him and eye balling the crib, whining (the crib is attached to our bed). I immediately lost my shit and screamed at him to get the dog off the fucking bed. I then accused him of deliberately enabling the dogs dangerous behavior, which the trainers and vets have already started is resource guarding and is a very big issue. He retorted with ""she's probably fucking acting like this because she wants more attention since she **hardly** gets it now that the baby is here"". To say that's utter bullshit is an understatement. If anything since we had the baby the dog is constantly on my husband's lap now and is never alone. I told him if he kept wanting to pull this shit than I can take the baby and go to a safe environment so he can give the dog all the attention she wants. He says I'm an AH for ""neglecting the dogs emotional needs"". AITA?"

If I couldn’t find a free version of the textbook online somewhere, I’d find a site selling cheap PDF copies online- it generally took a while to find the copies but it saved me quite a bit of money.  I always look online for free/cheap versions before my classes start. If I can’t find some, I’ll generally start the course and decide if I really need to buy the expensive version. (We’ve all been there- buying a textbook you don’t really use). In one of my classes, I initially couldn’t find any free or cheap pdf copies, I had looked online for a while. If I remember correctly the actual version was pretty expensive (150$ range) but it may have been less (110$ range). At first it seemed like I could get away relatively ok without using a textbook. About 2-3 weeks after the class started however, I realized it would be a better idea to just get one. I did the same thing, looked online, wasn’t having any luck. Then I found a version for about 40$. I bought it and went on my way. After thinking about it a little more, and realizing how hard it is in general to find those PDF versions, I thought to offer a cheap alternative with the rest of the class. I decided to send an email to everyone and sell copies of the version I bought for 5$. I thought this was a win-win; fellow students would get an ultra cheap version, I would off set my costs, and I didn’t feel like I was extorting anyone because 5$ is literally the price of a coffee. No one was going to be getting rich, and obviously other students can look for their own version aka no one is forced to buy anything. I would have appreciated the option to buy a cheap version if I was struggling to find my own. So I send this email, two people buy the textbook, then I get this really angry email about how it’s awful of me to be profiting off students who are already struggling and how I should be ashamed of myself. I nicely answered it and explained that I bought my version and wasn’t like “getting rich” off of broke students. I honestly don’t really get why the writer was so offended… It’s a 5$ textbook, which is ridiculously cheap, classes had been going on for over 3 weeks which is a long time semester wise, and also you have free will? 4 days later someone sends a link in the same email thread to a free version online. Now I feel like a pos… so AITA?"

But yesterday we were at his parent's place already so I thought ok then we can drive back with two cars and today he could just use the second car. He and his parents were like no that doesn't make sense at all, but I'm thinking regarding gas it wouldn't make no difference and timewise it would be beneficial for me. Afterwards my boyfriend told me that it really hurts him and I just don't want to be nice to him.  And for me it just feels off that not wanting to drive him equals not wanting to be nice. Is this logic adding up? Because thinking about it then yes with not driving him I'm deciding to not helping him out. But I just feel that it's not fair to say that I just don't want to be nice to him, since it's also not like I'm just deciding not to drive him and leave him alone, but I'm also thinking of a way that works for both of us."
