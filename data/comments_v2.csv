In saying  it’s never too later with a soulmate, she honored her love for Candice and her enthusiasm about their children instead of getting offended about your insulting question.  She is probably too nice to say, “Well, maybe you are too young to be a mother, not me too old.”    Being a mother doesn’t mean you don’t still have your own heart and your own truth.  Her truth is that your father was not a “soulmate” to her.  He did not treat her well.  In fact, he was controlling and abusive.  She found the strength to leave that man.  She moved on.  Maybe he was figuring out how to be better person when he died. Your truth was that you loved him, he was a doing better, and he was a good father to you.  Your reality is that you lost a father far too young, and that hurts.  I am sorry.  Grief is not always reasonable, and I think your attitude is coming out of a place of sadness.    However, if you are mature enough to be a wife and mother, you know better than to say something so rude to your mother.

It sounds like you don't really want her living with you anymore.  Which is fine.
