j66auqi,1,"One thing that needs to be understood about the difference about D&amp;D and videogames is that from a group of D&amp;D of 10 players, at most 2-3 will have the PHB.  &amp;#x200B;  And the DM is the one that is mostly invested into the game, he probably will be ""the vocal minority"" and that is what the execs at Hasbro thought ""There will be a backlash but we can sweep it under the rug and no one will care, just the vocal minority""   But what they dont understand is that the DMs dictates what the group of people play, either 5e, Pathfinder, OSE, DCC, you name it.   So DMs can be like ""You know what, we are not playing 5e anymore because WOTC fucked up, so we are playing something else instead"" and that is 10 5e less players, 1 person can change whole groups of people.  For example in my city i lead a small handful of DMs that teaches how to play D&amp;D 5e.  When this shitshow happen, we all bought Pathfinder, learn it and now we teach how to play PF 2e, the average player is not the wiser to know the difference between 5e and Pathfinder, they just know they are playing D&amp;D and we point them to Pathfinder if they want to expand their knowledge of the game, not only that but we are 10 DMs and each of us hosts D&amp;D groups, either public or private, total of 20-25 players each group and we all switched to Pathfinder.  As long as the players are rolling dice and slaying monsters and getting gold with friends, the average player does not care about the system but the system should care about the players.",/r/Games/comments/10mv8rb/wizards_of_the_coast_will_leave_the_existing_ogl/j66auqi/
