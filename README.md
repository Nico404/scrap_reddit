# scrap_reddit
little python project for scrapping AITA subreddit
Goal is to get post submissions and best comments to train 
an AI model to answer an AITA prompt

Since reddit api is limited in use, and pushshift api is down at the moment,
this little project is based on generated API URL from the unofficial
mirror https://camas.unddit.com/
