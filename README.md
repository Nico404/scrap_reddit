# scrap_reddit
little python project for scrapping AITA subreddit.
The goal is to get post submissions and their best comments to train 
an AI model to answer an AITA prompt

Since reddit api is limited in use, and pushshift api wrappers PAWR and PSAW are down or not maintened at the moment,
this little project is based on generated API URL from pushshift
