# scrap_reddit
little python project for scrapping AITA subreddit.
The goal is to get post submissions and their best comments to train 
an AI model to answer an AITA prompt

Since pushshift api wrappers PAWR and PSAW are down or not maintened at the moment, and the first attempt to use pushshift API yielded unexpected results from comments & overall unreliable data... 

This little project is based on generated API URL from the Reddit Official API 
https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/
