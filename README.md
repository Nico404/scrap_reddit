# scrap_reddit
This little python project for scrapping the /r/AITA subreddit.
The goal is to get post submissions and their best comments to train an AI model to answer an AITA prompt

Since the Pushshift API wrappers PAWR and PSAW are down or not maintained at the moment, and the first attempt to use the Pushshift API yielded unexpected results from comments & overall unreliable data we have based it on the Reddit Official API. It uses a simple pagination mechanism & saves already-processed posts persistently.

The content that can be pulled from the API at any given time is very limited by Design, so it is required to run this a few times to get a big enough Dataset.

    <td>I know this post sounds super petty, but this is the most ridiculous fight I've had with my boyfriend, and unfortunately it's where we're at.I [F28] have never shaved in my life. I think it's up to the person regardless, but I've also just never really had a lot of hair. My boyfriend recently stayed over and asked to borrow a razor. Since I don't shave, I didn't have one on hand, and apparently that grossed him out. He told me that it was unhygienic to not shave and we argued back and forth about the issue when I finally told him that I'd only start shaving my legs if he shaved his first. He called me immature and petty, whereas I think he's being super fixated on this weird thing. It honestly wouldn't really bother me to shave, but I'm just more irked at his statements where he basically called me dirty. I was serious though: I'll shave whenever he shaves too.We're at an impasse but I wonder if I am being a little too petty about the whole thing. </td>

  <td>My daughter Bryn F9 is going on a trip to a nearby water park with her class next week. She loves water and has been talking about it for months, so I was a bit thrown off when she came home crying a few days ago and told me she didn‚Äôt want to go... I immediately sent Ms. N an email condemning her actions. She sent me back an email with a bunch of bs that basically ended with ‚Äúif Bryn goes on the trip, she has to be Ben‚Äôs buddy.‚Äù</td>
